# ARCADES
sophisticated academic notetaking software inspired by Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project. 


ARCADES is an SQLITE-based notetaking application built around the needs of academic users in the humanities.
Design goals include quick, command-driven, workflow; elimation of redundancy in data entry (keywords specific to a given project can automatically be added to each note; the greatest possible logical expressiveness in searching; and organizational flexibility.  

Each note consists in a UNIQUE INDEX (a sequence of natural numbers), KEYWORDS and keyword TAGS, and a string of unicode text.

Notes can be linked by including the index of another note among the keywords. 

Tags can be subordinated into higher order genuses (Kant/German philosopher=philosopher=thinker)
Keywords can also be organized through relations. (Kant influenced Fichte, Fichte influenced Hegel)
Special "sequence keywords" can be used to keep track of page numbers, dates, or even index values.

It is possible to search over nearly all attributes of the note, and the seerch phrase permits full logical argiculativeness by combining terms with AND (&), OR (|), NOT (~), and nested parentheses.

The non-GUI display allows for RAPID cycling through notes with a variety of different iteration modes. 

The presentation of notes is simple yet elegant.

The structure of the notebook can be manipulated with powerful text commands, and it is possible to "feed" the result of searches back into other commands.
