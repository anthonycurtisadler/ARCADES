<@5.1@ Notice how the word "seems" appears here. THIS establishes very clear that Aristotle is talking about the realm of "seeming", {doxa}.

The {telos} is to be found in the first instance in the "realm" of {doxa} {opinion} -- Suggesting {phenomenology}.

This is a very significant point for my own interpretation of how Aristotle will challenge the position of {Plato}, and above all else, the way in which {Plato} conceives of the philosopher as the master of truth, so to speak...

<@5.1.1@ {Aquinas} {Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics} 
{lecture@1} "It is the business of the wise man to order. The reason for this is that wisdom is the most powerful perfection of reason whose characteristic is to know order. Even if the sensitive powers know somethings absolutely, nevertheless to know the order of one thing to another is exclusively the word of intellect or reason" 
 Sicut philosophus dicit in principio metaphysicae, sapientis est ordinare. Cuius ratio est, quia sapientia est potissima perfectio rationis, cuius proprium est cognoscere ordinem. Nam etsi vires sensitivae cognoscant res aliquas absolute, ordinem tamen unius rei ad aliam cognoscere est solius intellectus aut rationis. Invenitur autem duplex ordo in rebus. Unus quidem partium alicuius totius seu alicuius multitudinis adinvicem, sicut partes domus ad invicem ordinantur; alius autem est ordo rerum in finem. Et hic ordo est principalior, quam primus. Nam, ut philosophus dicit in XI metaphysicae, ordo partium exercitus adinvicem, est propter ordinem totius exercitus ad ducem. Ordo autem quadrupliciter ad rationem comparatur. Est enim quidam ordo quem ratio non facit, sed solum considerat, sicut est ordo rerum naturalium. Alius autem est ordo, quem ratio considerando facit in proprio actu, puta cum ordinat conceptus suos adinvicem, et signa conceptuum, quae sunt voces significativae; tertius autem est ordo quem ratio considerando facit in operationibus voluntatis. Quartus autem est ordo quem ratio considerando facit in exterioribus rebus, quarum ipsa est causa, sicut in arca et domo.

Therefore in the speculative intellect he includes teaching by which science is conveyed from teacher to student, while in the practical intellect he locates art which is right reason applies to things to be made, as is stated in the sixth book of this word {bekker@1153} He indicates that the act of the appetitive intellect is choice, and that execution is "actus" He does not mention prudence, which is in the practical reason together with art, because choice is properly directed by prudence. He says therefore that each of these faculties obviously seeks some good as an end

Aristotle's basic argument for why there must  be an ultimate {telos} {agathon} -- "supreme  good"  

_Εἰ δή τι τέλος ἐστὶ τῶν πρακτῶν ὃ δι’ αὑτὸ  βουλόμεθα, τἆλλα δὲ διὰ τοῦτο, καὶ μὴ πάντα  δι’ ἕτερον αἱρούμεθα (πρόεισι γὰρ οὕτω γ’ εἰς  ἄπειρον, πάντα δι’ ἕτερον αἱρούμεθα (πρόεισι  γὰρ οὕτω γ’ εἰς ἄπειρον, (20) ὥστ’ εἶναι κενὴν  καὶ ματαίαν τὴν ὄρεξιν), δῆλον ὡς τοῦτ’ ἂν  εἴη τἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ ἄριστον. ἆρ’ οὖν καὶ πρὸς  τὸν βίον ἡ γνῶσις αὐτοῦ μεγάλην ἔχει ῥοπήν,  καὶ καθάπερ τοξόται σκοπὸν ἔχοντες μᾶλλον ἂν  τυγχάνοιμεν τοῦ δέοντος; εἰ δ’ οὕτω, πειρατέον  τύπῳ γε περιλαβεῖν αὐτὸ τί ποτ’ ἐστὶ καὶ (25)  τίνος τῶν ἐπιστημῶν ἢ δυνάμεων. δόξειε δ’ ἂν  τῆς κυριω- τάτης καὶ μάλιστα ἀρχιτεκτονικῆς.  τοιαύτη δ’ ἡ πολιτικὴ φαίνεται· τίνας γὰρ εἶναι  χρεὼν τῶν ἐπιστημῶν ἐν ταῖς πό- (1094b) λεσι,  καὶ ποίας ἑκάστους μανθάνειν καὶ μέχρι τίνος,  αὕτη διατάσσει· ὁρῶμεν δὲ καὶ τὰς ἐντιμοτάτας  τῶν δυνάμεων  

[####] 
If therefore among the ends at which our actions  aim there is one which we wish for its own  sake, whgile we wish the others only for the  sake of this, and if we do not choose everything  for the sake of something else (which would  obviously result in a process ad infinitum,  so that all desire would be futile and vain)  it is clear that this one ultimate end must  be the good, and indeed the supreme good. Will  not then a knowledge of this Supreme Good be  also of great practical importance for the  conduct of life? Will it not better enable  us to attain what is fitting, like archers  {archery} {METAPHOR} having a target to aim  at? If this be so, we ought to make an attempt  to determine at all events in outline what  exactly this Supreme Good is, and of which  of the theoretical or practical sciences it  is the object.

<@8.1@ But political science dictates to a speculative science only as to activity, not concerning the specification of its proper activity. Political science orders that some teach or learn geometry, and actions of this kind insofar as they are voluntary belong to the matter of ethics and can be ordered to the goal of human living. But the political ruler does not dictate to geometry what conclusions it should draw about a triangle, for this is not subject to the human will nor can it be ordered to human living

<$title@Commens of Aspasius the Philosopher on Aristotle's Ethics,COMMENTARY@12.0,translator@David Konstan,vita activa,vita contemplativa,page@3,author@Aspasius,commentaryof@Nicomachean Ethics,REFLECTION >
<@8.1.1@ The treatment of ethics and especially politics is prior to contemplative philosophy in respect to necessity, but subsequent in respect to value.
Insofar as it is impossible for people to live nobly if they are not temperate, just, and in general well ordered in their character, having settled the emotions of their souls in some sort of equilibrium, the political and ethical treatise would seem necessary and therefore prior (for even if a person should acquire total knowledge and contemplative wisdom, it is of no use if he has not been educated in regard to character). But insofar as wisdom treats the most valuable and divine things, and contemplates the works of nature and, beyond that, other things far better and greater than those constituted by nature, which pertain to first philosophy,1 contemplative philosophy may be said to be prior and more valuable. For as the subjects stand to one another, so too the sciences of these subjects; the things that wisdom deals with are more valuable and greater than those that fall under political and ethical science; thus, wisdom is far more valuable than those sciences.
For in fact, if we were without bodies, there would be no need for our nature to have any other work than contemplation. As it is, however, the nature of the body, which is yoked to bodily pleasures and pains, necessarily causes us to be concerned with temperance, self-control, and many other such virtues which do not plausibly pertain to god because he has no share in bodily pleasures and pains. It is because of the necessity of the body, then, it seems, that we take greatest concern for ethics, since even justice and practical intelligence, in which the divine is believed to share, are far inferior to god. We, however, need them because of the injustices and aggressions that are committed by us against each other, whereas it is plausible that the divine, at all events, exercises only contemplative justice in regard to us and is continually in this state

<@8.2@ he shows that political science is the most important science from the very nature of its special end. It is evident that insofar as a cause is prior and more powerful it extends to more effects. Hence, insofar as the food, which has the nature of a final cause, is more powerful, it extends to more effects. So even though the good be the same objective for one man and for the whole state, it seems much better and more perfect to attain, that is, to procure and persevre the good of the whole state...Nation 
This is said to be more divine because it shows greater likeness to God who is the ultimate cause of all good. BUt this good common to one or to several states is the object of our inquiry, that is, of the particular skill called political science

<@19.1@ Without doubt a {propositional} concept of {truth} belongs at the core of Aristotle's project. Nevertheless, it seems significant that this is presented already in the {Categories}.

The Categories concerns the language as a means of signification; how meaning is established at the most basic level.

It is equivalent to the language of the cave; in which, as we saw, a "correspondence theory of truth" exists.

But of course, here we also find the kernel of Aristotle's critique of Plato. 
Aristotle's "cave" is not so far from the "truth"... Or indeed: the "thing in itself," being, is articulated through language...

<@20@ 
To return to {affirmation} and {negation} {kataphasis} {apophasis}. Of these we may say in all cases that one must be false and one true, be the subject existent or not. For if Socrates really exists, 'he is ill' or 'not ill' must be true; 'he is ill' or 'not ill' must be false. And the same, if he does not exist. For, provided he does not exist, it is false to pronounce 'he is ill'; 'he is not ill', however, is true. For, provided he does not exist, it is false to pronounce 'he is ill'; 'he is not ill', however, is true. Thus that one of the trwo must be true and the other be false in all cases will hold of those oppositess only which are in the same sense opposed as affirmative and negative statements.

{truth} // {REFLECTION} 
THIS Seems on the surface like a very curious claim. It doesn't seem to allow the possibility of a vague or ill-formulated sentence...

We might ask, then: ON what basis would it be true? 
It seems to presuppose that a affirmative statement is made true by something "actively" "actually" being the case; Hence, either this exists, or it does not exist. So, if Socrates does not exist, then "Socrates is Ill" is false, since the Socrates-being-Ill is not given. 
The non-existence of the subject of predication entails the non-existence of the truth-making fact

<@21@ {priority} {prōteros} 
Being prior is said in four different ways: 
(1) In the most proper sense: with reference to time.

(2) Of an order that is fixed and cannot be reversed. Such as "one" is prior to "two" {number} {order} 

{3} with regard to any order whatever. And this is the case in the sciences, and also in the speeches 
{4} Besides the three senses aforesaid, whatsoever is better, more honorable, is said to be naturally prior. 
Thus the common folk, speaking of those whom they hold in esteem or affection, describe them as coming first with them or having prior place in their hearts.

But this use seems the strangest of all. ἔστι μὲν δὴ σχεδὸν ἀλλοτριώτατος τῶν τρόπων οὗτος.

<@22@ {prior} {DISTINCTION} But there is also a fifth sense 
Yet another might seem to exist beyhond those we have already mentioned. For where in the case of two things the existence of either implies or necessitates that of the other, that thing which is somehow the cause may, in consequence, fairly be considered as naturally prior to the other. Such cases can clearly be found. The existence of a man, for example, necessitates the truth of the statement wherein we assert his existence. The converse is also the case. For if he exists, then the statement asserting that fact will be true. If the statement, conversely, is true, then the man referred to must exist. The true statement however is nowise the cause of the man's thus existing; and yet his existence would seem in some manner or other the cause of the truth of the true proposition. For the latter is called "true" or "false," as the man thus exists or does not. So it seems that we use the term prior in as many as five different senses.

First, you have the "primary" sense of {priority} -- is primacy itself a kind of prioirity -- and then you have two senses derived from this, both of which seem to belong to a more "sceintific" mode of discourse, then you have the "strange" usage of the common people--(what is the sense of the strangeness, one might ask)--and finally you have a very specific philosophical sense...Which is explained with special reference to the question of "truth"...Not that this is the only example...

<@23@ {having} {echein/gr} 
'To have" is said in many ways. We use it of habits {exis/gr} and dispositions {diathesis/gr} and of all the other qualities.

Thus we are said to "have" virtue, to have this or that piece of knowledge.

And then it is use of a quantity, such as the height a man has. 
So it is that we say that a man "has" a stature of three or four cubits. Again, it is used of apparel.

...Moreover, we use it of things that we 'have' on some part of the body, a ring on the finger, for instance.
We employ it of parts of the body...a man 'has' a hand or a foot. It is used in the case of a vessel; a jar will be said to 'have' wine, and a corn-measure to 'have' wheat.

And in cases like these we are thinking of what is contained in the vessel. Once more, we use 'have' of a property, men 'having' houses or fields.

People say that a man 'has' a wife and wife, in like manner, has a husband. This meaning is very far-fetched. {allotriōtatos/gr} When we say that a man has a wife, then we mean that he lives with her merely. 
There may be more senses of 'have'...But the customary meanings, I think, are set forth in the foregoing summary.

THE discussion of "having" is quite peculiar, and especially the last remark...

It would be easy to account for a "husband" having a "wife" " by saying that something "has" a relation. In English, at least, such a claim would seem to come very naturally. A father has a son, a son has a father; someone "has" a country.

In the usage of Greek so fundamentally different??

As men can affirm and deny both the presence of that which is present and the presence of that which is absent and this they can do with a reference to times that lie outside the present, whatever a man may affirm, it is possible as well to deny, and whatever a man may deny, it is possible as well to affirm. Thus, it follows, each affirmative statement will have its own opposite negative, just as each negative statement will have its affirmative oppositve. Every such pair of propositions we, therefore, shall call contradictories, always assuming the predicates and subejcts are really the same and the terms used without ambiguity, These and some other provisos are needed in view of the puzzles propounded by importunate sophists.

REGARDING The {RELATION} of the {truth} of a {proposition} to {time}

When however we come to propositions whose subjects are singular terms, while their predicates refer to the future and not to the present or past, then we find that the case is quite changed. Propositions, whether positive or negative, being themselves true or false, every predicate that we affrim must belong to its subject or not. Hence it is that, if someone declares that a certain event will take place, while another declares that it will note, one will clearly be speaking the truth, while the other clearly will not. Both predicates cannot belong to one subject with regard to the future. For, if it is true to pronounce some particular thing to be white, it must be of necessity white. The reverse of this also holds good. As again it is white or not white, it was true to affirm or deny it. And, if it is not, in fact, white, then to that that it is will be false; it to say that it is will be false, then it follows that the thing is not white. We are driven, therefore, to concluding that all affirmations and denials must either be true or false.

Now, it all this is so, there is nothing that happens by chance or fortuitously; nothing will ever happen. 
ὥστ’ ἀνάγκη τὴν κατάφασιν ἢ τὴν ἀπόφασιν ἀληθῆ εἶναι.
οὐδὲν ἄρα οὔτε ἔστιν οὔτε γίγνεται οὔτε ἀπὸ τύχης οὔθ’ (5) ὁπότερ’ ἔτυχεν, οὐδ’ ἔσται ἢ οὐκ ἔσται, ἀλλ’ ἐξ ἀνάγκης ἅπαν- @1 τα καὶ οὐχ ὁπότερ’ ἔτυχεν (ἢ γὰρ ὁ φὰς ἀληθεύει ἢ ὁ ἀπο- φάς)· 

All this is however impossible. We know from out personal experience that future events may depend on the counsels and actions of men, and that, speaking more broadly, those things that are not uninterrupedly actual exhibit a potentiality, that is, a "may or may not be" 
-ὁρῶμεν γὰρ ὅτι ἔστιν ἀρχὴ τῶν ἐσομένων καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ βουλεύεσθαι καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ πρᾶξαί τι, καὶ ὅτι ὅλως ἔστιν ἐν τοῖς μὴ ἀεὶ ἐνεργοῦσι τὸ δυνατὸν εἶναι καὶ μή, ἐν οἷς ἄμφω ἐνδέχεται καὶ τὸ εἶναι καὶ τὸ (10) μὴ εἶναι, ὥστε καὶ τὸ γενέσθαι καὶ τὸ μὴ γενέσθαι· 
{archē} {dunaton/gr} 

Thus it is clear that not everything is or takes place of necessity.

<@42.1@ THIS is an extremely important and subtle point, and gets at the heart of Aristotle's account of {truth} and its {RELATION} to {being}.

Could we say that it involves an distinction between three levels of inquiry: 

(1) Actual states of affairs that can be or not be the case. 
(2) A "metaphysical" claim regarding "determininism" or "non-determinism", or in other words, regarding the way in which states of affairs are connected to one another.

(3) A claim about the "logical structure" of the world. (NOT that Aristotle puts it this way of course. {compare@Wittgenstein}) 

A proposition {kataphasis} is true according to whether it speaks correctly about actual states of affairs. Even when it is speaking of an event that has not yet taken place...It is still either true or false, and not somehoe indeterminate.

And yet, no conclusion can be derived from about the metaphysical structure of the world---whether it is determinate or if there is free will.

The necessity is a "logical" necessity, and this alone... 
BUT ultimately this suggests the {phenomenological} basis of Aristotle's thought..."free will" is phenomenological evident, but so is the "logical structure" of truth...

<@49.12@ {doxa} {EXPLANATION} 
But inasmuch as a bad deliberator makes mistakes and a good deliberator deliberates correctly, it is clear that Deliberative Excellence is some form of correctness; thought it is not correctness of knowledge, nor of opinion. Correctness cannot be predicated of knowledge, any more than error, and correctness of opinion is truth; and also any matter about which one has an opinion has been settled already; [then again Deliberative Excellence necessarily involves conscious calculation. It remains therefore that Deliberative Excellence is correctness in thinking, for thought has not reached the stage of affirmation;] for Opinion has passed beyond the stage of investigation and is a form of affirmation, whereas a man deliberating, whether he deliberates well or badly, is investigating and calculating something.

AN extremely interesting passage ...What is the difference between correctness and error? 
Knowledge can neither be correct nor erroneous (this is as in English)...But it can be true...
Correctness of opinion is truth...SO THEN: truth would not seem to apply as a predicate of knowledge...
[It would make sense, I think, to say that the predication of truth does not apply to knowledge..In so far as true means "correct" rather than "disclosive"...

knowledge is certainly true in the sense of disclosive, but it is not true in the sense of correctness...since correspondence isn't an issue...] 
So opinion is the province of truth...(as belonging to a proposition)

Understanding or Good Understanding, the quality in virtue of which we call men 'person of understanding' or 'of good understanding,' is not the same thing as Scientific Knowledge in general (nor yet is it the same as Opinion, for in that case everybody would have understanding), nor is it any one of the particular sciences, as medicine is the science of what pertains to health and geomtery the science concerned with magnitudes. For understanding dow not deal with the things that exist for every and are immutable, nor yet with all of the things that come into existence, buit with those about which one may be in doubt and deliberate. Hence it is concerned with the same objects as {prudence} {phronēsis/gr} {RELATION}

Understanding is not however the same thing as prudence; for prudence issues commands, since its end is a statement of what we ought to do or not to do, whereas understanding merely makes judgments. (For understanding is the same as good understanding; a 'man of understanding' means a man of good understanding.') 
διὸ περὶ τὰ αὐτὰ μὲν τῇ φρονήσει ἐστίν, οὐκ ἔστι δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ σύνεσις καὶ φρόνησις. ἡ μὲν γὰρ φρόνησις ἐπιτακτική ἐστιν· τί γὰρ δεῖ πράττειν ἢ μή, τὸ τέλος αὐτῆς ἐστίν· ἡ δὲ σύνεσις κριτικὴ μόνον. ταὐτὸ γὰρ σύνεσις καὶ εὐσυνεσία καὶ συ- (10) νετοὶ καὶ εὐσύνετο

In fact, the use of the term understanding to denote theb quality that makes men "persons of good understanding" is derived from understanding as shown in learning; in fact we often use "to learn" in the sense of "to understand"

<@49.18@ All these qualities, it is reasonable to say, refer to the same thing; indeed we attribute Considerateness, Understanding, Prudence, and Intelligence to the same person when we say of people that they 'are old enough to show consideration and intelligence,' and are prudent and understanding persons. FOr all these faculties deal with ultimate and particular things; and a man has understanding and is considerate, or considerate for others, when he is a good judge of the matters in regard to which prudence is displayed; because equitable actions are common to all good men in their behavior toward others, while on the other hand all matters of conduct belong to the class or particular and ultimate things (since the prudent man admittedly has to take congizance of these things), and Understanding and Consideration deal with matters of conduct, which are ultimate. Also Intelligence apprehends the ultimates in both aspects--since ultimates as well as primary definitions {protos horos/syntagm} {horos} are grasped by intelligence {nous} and not reached by reasoning {logos}; in demonstrations {apodeixis} intelligence apprehends the immutable and primary definitions, in practical inferences {praktikais} the ultimate and contingent fact, and the minor premise, since these are the first principles from whcih the end is inferred, as general rules are based on particular cases; hence we must have perception of particulars, and this immediate perception is intelligence.

Εἰσὶ δὲ πᾶσαι αἱ ἕξεις εὐλόγως εἰς ταὐτὸ τείνουσαι· (25) λέγομεν γὰρ γνώμην καὶ σύνεσιν καὶ φρόνησιν καὶ νοῦν ἐπὶ τοὺς αὐτοὺς ἐπιφέροντες γνώμην ἔχειν καὶ νοῦν ἤδη καὶ φρονίμους καὶ συνετούς. πᾶσαι γὰρ αἱ δυνάμεις αὗται τῶν ἐσχάτων εἰσὶ καὶ τῶν καθ’ ἕκαστον· καὶ ἐν μὲν τῷ κριτικὸς εἶναι περὶ ὧν ὁ φρόνιμος, συνετὸς καὶ εὐγνώμων (30) ἢ συγγνώμων· τὰ γὰρ ἐπιεικῆ κοινὰ τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἁπάν- των ἐστὶν ἐν τῷ πρὸς ἄλλον. ἔστι δὲ τῶν καθ’ ἕκαστα καὶ τῶν ἐσχάτων ἅπαντα τὰ πρακτά· καὶ γὰρ τὸν φρόνιμον δεῖ γινώσκειν αὐτά, καὶ ἡ σύνεσις καὶ ἡ γνώμη περὶ τὰ πρακτά, ταῦτα δ’ ἔσχατα. καὶ ὁ νοῦς τῶν ἐσχάτων ἐπ’ (35) ἀμφότερα· καὶ γὰρ τῶν πρώτων ὅρων καὶ τῶν ἐσχάτων (1143b) νοῦς ἐστὶ καὶ οὐ λόγος, καὶ ὁ μὲν κατὰ τὰς ἀποδείξεις (1143b) νοῦς ἐστὶ καὶ οὐ λόγος, καὶ ὁ μὲν κατὰ τὰς ἀποδείξεις τῶν ἀκινήτων ὅρων καὶ πρώτων, ὁ δ’ ἐν ταῖς πρακτικαῖς τοῦ ἐσχάτου καὶ ἐνδεχομένου καὶ τῆς ἑτέρας προτάσεως· ἀρχαὶ γὰρ τοῦ οὗ ἕνεκα αὗται· ἐκ τῶν καθ’ ἕκαστα γὰρ τὰ καθόλου· τούτων οὖν ἔχειν δεῖ αἴσθησιν, αὕτη δ’ ἐστὶ νοῦς. @1 (5) διὸ καὶ φυσικὰ δοκεῖ εἶναι ταῦτα, καὶ φύσει σοφὸς μὲν οὐδείς, γνώμην δ’ ἔχειν καὶ σύνεσιν καὶ νοῦν. σημεῖον δ’ ὅτι καὶ ταῖς ἡλικίαις οἰόμεθα ἀκολουθεῖν, καὶ ἥδε ἡ ἡλικία νοῦν ἔχει καὶ γνώμην, ὡς τῆς φύσεως αἰτίας οὔσης.

This is why it is thought that these qualities are a natural gift, and that a man is considerate, understanding, and intelligent by nature, though no one is a wise man by nature. That is so is indicated by our thinking of them as going with certain ages; we say that at such and such an age a man must have got intelligence {nous} and considerateness {gnōm/emacron}, which implies that they come from nature. 
[Hence intelligence is both a beginning and an end, for these things are both the starting-point and the subject matter of demonstration] 
Consequently, the unproved assertions and opinions of experiences and elderly people, or of prudent men, are as much deserving of attention as those which they support by proof; for experience has given them an eye for things, and so they see correctly.

Wisdom does not consider the means to human happiness at all, for it does not ask how anything comes into existence. 
Prudence, it must be granted, does do this; but what do we need it for? seeing that it studies that which is just and noble and good for man, but these are the things that a good man does by nature. Knowing about them doesn't make us any more capable of doing them, since the virtues are qualities of character.

While some do just deeds but are not just men, there is a way of comporting oneself to do these things such that one is good.

Now rightness in our choice of an end is secured by (moral) virtue; but to do the actions that must in the nature of things be done in order to attain the end we have chosen, is not a matter for virtue but for a different faculty. 
λεκτέον δ’ ἐπιστήσασι σα- φέστερον περὶ αὐτῶν. ἔστι δὴ δύναμις ἣν καλοῦσι δει- @1 νότητα· 
We must dwell on this point to make it more clear.

There is a certain faculty called cleverness {deinotēta} which is the capacity for doing the things aforesaid that conduce to the end we propose, and so attaining that end.

_αὕτη δ’ ἐστὶ τοιαύτη ὥστε τὰ πρὸς τὸν ὑποτεθέντα σκοπὸν συντείνοντα δύνασθαι ταῦτα πράττειν καὶ τυγχά-\νειν αὐτοῦ. ἂν μὲν οὖν ὁ σκοπὸς ᾖ καλός, ἐπαινετή ἐστιν, ἐὰν δὲ φαῦλος, πανουργία 
If the aim is noble, this is a praiseworthy faculty, but if base, it is mere knavery

this is how we come to speak of both prudent men and knaves as clever.

στι δ’ ἡ φρόνησις οὐχ ἡ δύ- ναμις, ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἄνευ τῆς δυνάμεως ταύτης.

Now this caulty is not identical with prudence, but prudence implies it.

ἡ δ’ ἕξις τῷ ὄμματι τούτῳ γίνεται τῆς ψυχῆς οὐκ ἄνευ ἀρετῆς, ὡς (30) εἴρηταί τε καὶ ἔστι δῆλον· 
But that eye of the soul [??] of which we spoke cannot acquire the quality of Prudence without possessing Virtue. This we have said before, for it is manifestly true.

_οἱ γὰρ συλλογισμοὶ τῶν πρα- κτῶν ἀρχὴν ἔχοντές εἰσιν, ἐπειδὴ τοιόνδε τὸ τέλος καὶ τὸ ἄριστον, ὁτιδήποτε ὄν (ἔστω γὰρ λόγου χάριν τὸ τυχόν)· 
For deductive inferences about matters of conduct always have a major premise of the form Since the End or Supreme good is so and so (whatever it may be, since we may take it as anything we like for the sake of argument) 
τοῦτο δ’ εἰ μὴ τῷ ἀγαθῷ, οὐ φαίνεται· 
but the supreme good only appears good to the good man; 
διαστρέφει γὰρ ἡ μοχθηρία καὶ διαψεύδεσθαι ποιεῖ περὶ τὰς πρακτικὰς ἀρ- (35) χάς. ὥστε φανερὸν ὅτι ἀδύνατον φρόνιμον εἶναι μὴ ὄντα (1144b) ἀγαθόν 
vice perverts the mind and causes it to hold false views about the first principles of conduct. Hence it is clear that we cannot be prudent without being good

<@49.24@ We have therefore also to reconsider the nature of Virtue.

Draws a distinction between {natural virtue} and {authoritative virtue} {kuria} 
{authoritative virtue} cannot exist without prudence 
{Socrates} said that all the virtues are prudence. This is wrong. It is correct however that virtues cannot exist without prudence.

"A proof of this is that everyone, even at the present day, in defining virtue , after saying what disposition it is and specifying the things with which it is concerned, adds that it is a disposition determined by the right principle; and the right principle is determined by prudence." 
σημεῖον δέ· καὶ γὰρ νῦν πάντες, ὅταν ὁρίζωνται τὴν ἀρετήν, προστιθέασι, τὴν ἕξιν εἰπόντες καὶ πρὸς ἅ ἐστι, τὴν κατὰ τὸν ὀρθὸν λόγον· ὀρθὸς δ’ ὁ κατὰ τὴν φρόνησιν. ἐοίκασι δὴ μαντεύεσθαί πως ἅπαντες ὅτι ἡ τοιαύτη ἕξις ἀρετή ἐστιν, ἡ κατὰ τὴν φρόνησιν.

It appears therefore that everybody in some sense divines that Virtue is a disposition of this nature, namely regulated by prudence. 
This formula however however requires a slight modification.

_δεῖ (25) δὲ μικρὸν μεταβῆναι.

Virtue is not merely a disposition conforming to right principle; but one co-operating with right principle; and prudence is right principle in matters of conduct 
ἔστι γὰρ οὐ μόνον ἡ κατὰ τὸν ὀρθὸν λόγον, ἀλλ’ ἡ μετὰ τοῦ ὀρθοῦ λόγου ἕξις ἀρετή ἐστιν· ὀρθὸς δὲ λόγος περὶ τῶν τοιούτων ἡ φρόνησίς ἐστιν.

Σωκράτης μὲν οὖν λόγους τὰς ἀρετὰς ᾤετο εἶναι (ἐπιστήμας γὰρ εἶναι

<@49.25@ {Socrates} then thought that the virtues are principles, for he said that they are all of them forms of knowledge. We on the other hand say that the virtues co-operate with principles.

These considerations therefore show that it is not possible to be good in the true sense without prudence, nor to be prudent without moral virtue.

<@49.26@ These considerations therefore show that it is not possible to be good in the authoritative sense without prudence, nor to be prudent without moral virtue.

δῆλον οὖν ἐκ τῶν εἰρημένων (30) ὅτι οὐχ οἷόν τε ἀγαθὸν εἶναι κυρίως ἄνευ φρονήσεως, οὐδὲ φρόνιμον ἄνευ τῆς ἠθικῆς ἀρετῆς.

If some one has one of the virtues of prudence, he will have them all... 
ῆλον δέ, κἂν εἰ μὴ πρακτικὴ ἦν, ὅτι ἔδει ἂν αὐτῆς διὰ τὸ τοῦ μορίου ἀρετὴν εἶναι, καὶ ὅτι οὐκ ἔσται ἡ προαίρεσις ὀρθὴ ἄνευ φρονήσεως οὐδ’ ἄνευ ἀρετῆς· ἣ μὲν γὰρ τὸ τέλος ἣ δὲ (5) τὰ πρὸς τὸ τέλος ποιεῖ πράττειν. ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδὲ κυρία γ’ ἐστὶ τῆς σοφίας οὐδὲ τοῦ βελτίονος μορίου, ὥσπερ οὐδὲ @1 τῆς ὑγιείας ἡ ἰατρική· οὐ γὰρ χρῆται αὐτῇ, ἀλλ’ ὁρᾷ ὅπως γένηται· ἐκείνης οὖν ἕνεκα ἐπιτάττει, ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἐκείνῃ.
ἔτι ὅμοιον κἂν εἴ τις τὴν πολιτικὴν φαίη ἄρχειν τῶν θεῶν, (10) ὅτι ἐπιτάττει περὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν τῇ πόλει.

It is therefore clear that, even if prudence had no bearing on conduct, it would still be needed, because it is the virtue of that part of the intellect to which it belongs; and also that our choice of actions will not be right without prudence any more than without moral virtue, since, while moral virtue enables us to achieve the end, prudence makes us adopt the right means to the end.

But nevertheless it is not really the case that prudence is in authority over wisdom, or ovber the higher part of the intellect, any more than medical science is in authority over health.
Medical science does not control health, but studes how to procure it; hence it issues orders in the interests of health, but not to health. And again, one might as well say that political science governs the gods, because it gives orders about everything in the state.

For it makes a great difference with regard to producing conviction--especially in demonstrative and next to this in forensic oratory---that the speaker should show himself to be possessed of certain qualities and that his hearers should think that he is disposed in a certain way towards them; and further, that they themselves should be disposed in a certain way towards him

<@136.1@ {REFLECTION} 
THIS PASSAGE is extremely important for my reading of the Rhetoric, since it suggests the extent to which the intimations of a radical conception of the {life world} of {phenoemnology}, but with a specifically political sense, can be found in the Rhetoric.

This suggests a specifically {political} mode of {truth}, which is characterized not by the {disclosure} of the {objects} of properly scientific quality, but rather by the "appearing" of the objects of "care" according to the emotional disposition of the members of the community.

Of decisive significance here is the limited attentional space of the {agora} or {ekklesia} {assembly}. 
This is very different from the potentially infinite space of scientific truth...The model of which might be the {library}... 
While scientific truth is organized according to the {importance} of the thing itself, its primacy in the relation of causes and effects---hence God as the highest object of contemplation---the truth of the sphere of opinion, political truth as we might say (or political opinion---The terminology is indeed going to get rather confusing)---is organized according to "care"

We have already said that the enthymeme is a kind of syllogism, what makes it so, and in what it differs from the dialectic syllogisms; for the conclusion must neither be drawn from too far back, nor should it include all the steps of the argument. In the first case its length causes obscurity, in the second, it is simply a waste of words, because it states much that is obvious.

It is this that makes the ignorant more persuasive than the educated in the presence of crowds; as the poets say "the ignorant are more skilled at speaking before a mob"

<@236@ {fallacy} CONTINUED --- {DIVISION} there are more than two!! 
3) Another fallacy consists in combining what is divided, or dividing what is combined 
4) Another is that of constructing or destroying by exaggeration, which takes place when the speaker, without having proved that any crime has actually been committed, exaggerates the supposed fact 
5) Another fallacy is that of the sign, for this argument also is illogical...For instance, if one were to say that those who love one another are useful to States, since the love of Harmodius and Aristogiton overthrew the tryant Hipparchus 
6) Another fallacy is derived from accident 
7) Another fallacy is that of consequence 
"For instance, in the ALexander (Paris) it is said that Paris is high-minded, because he despised the companionship of the common herd and dwelt on Ida by himself, for because the high-minded are of this character, Paris might also be high-minded" 
8) Another fallacy consists in taking what is not the cause for the cause, as when a thing has happened at the same time or after another 

9) Another fallacy is the ommision of when and how 
10) considering a thing first absolute, and then not absolutely, but only in a particular case. 
"For instance, in Dialectic, it is argued that that which is not *is*, for that which is not *is* that which is not; also, that the unknown can be known, for it can be known of the unknown that it is unknown" 
Similarly, in Rhetoric, an apparent enthymeme may arise from that which is not absolutely probably but only in particular cases. But this is not to be understood absolute...

Easy learning is naturally pleasant to all, and words mean something so that all words which make us learn something are most pleasant. 
Now, we do not know the meaning of strange words, and proper terms we know already. It is metaphor, therefore, that above all produces this effect; for when Homer calls old age stubble, he teaches and informs us through the genus; for both have lost their bloom 
· ἀρχὴ δ’ ἔστω ἡμῖν αὕτη. τὸ γὰρ μανθάνειν ῥᾳδίως ἡδὺ φύσει πᾶσιν ἐστί, τὰ δὲ ὀνόματα σημαίνει τι, ὥστε ὅσα τῶν ὀνομάτων (10)

The latter actually identified soul and mind; for he believed that truth is subjective. Hence he regards Homer's description in his swooning as "lying thinking other thoughts" as accurate [i.e. his delusions are true] He does not then employ the term mind as denoting a faculty concerned with the truth, but identifies the soul and the mind.

<@304@ {truth} 
The thinking of indivisible objects of thought occurs among things concerning which there can be no falsehood; where truth and falsehood are possible there is implied a compounding of thoughts into a fresh unity, as {Empedocles/presocratic philosopher=philosopher} "where without necks the heads of many grew" and then were joined together by love...so also these separate entities are combined, as for instance incommensurable and diagonal.

But if the thinking is concerned with things past or future, then we take into account and include the notion of time. For {falsehood} always lies in the process of {combination}

<@304.1@ 
But why should Aristotle say that proper perception is "always true" ( 
_$% , 427b11-12)? Plato’s Theaetetus 186c-e denies that sense gets to truth at all; only thought can get to truth. Previously in 418a11-12 Aristotle claimed proper perception cannot be deceived ([ ( $ ), while now he insists that it is true. Its truth cannot consist in making judgments and getting to essence, as thought may. Sense instead captures what is to be perceived, the truth or reality of the sensible object. Sense accurately discriminates what is there to be discriminated because the sense and its object, as stated in 425b26-27, are in actuality the same.
What the sense actually perceives is what there is under the present conditions of the object, medium, and organ. And he can say that it always gets the truth not because it is never inaccurate (cf. 428b18-19) but because as a class the proper senses as available to all the animals are authoritative in their fields. There is no criterion for them beyond themselves, whereas thought can be checked by sense perception. If we seem to perceive something poorly - and a proper sense can do this when we are too far away, distracted, sick, and so on - the same sense in a better condition has to reassess what is perceived. Moreover, even misperception need not be or occasion a false judgment.

{Paraphrase of de Anima/text} 
109.4 (430a26-31): So when this potential intellect acquires its own form through the productive intellect illuminating it,176 it first thinks the uncombined and undivided things that are signified (the ones distinguished in the categories), in which there is not yet truth and falsity. But as it progresses177 it also combines them with one another (e.g., "Socrates" with "walks"), and in these truth and falsity is indeed present. And it does not combine them like a heap, but so as to make the many one again, and to embrace in one act of thought the plurality of uncombined things that are signified. "Socrates does philosophy," that is, is like this, and this combination of thoughts resembles the combination of limbs in em pedo cles178 by which Love, for him, combines the scattered limbs of animals. And just as for him not every combination of limbs produces an animal, so neither in this case does every combination [produce] truth, but one type produces truth, another falsity (e.g., the combination of the incommensurable with the diagonal produces truth, but that of the commensurable falsity). And just as in his case the animal duly emerges uncombined out of uncombined limbs, so does the statement duly emerge uncombined out of uncombined things that are signified.17

<@304.5@ 112.8 (430b26-27): And truth in its case is without qualification; indeed it is itself truth, as it does not express truth by thinking something else but by thinking itself. Our intellect, on the other hand, insofar as it has a slight resemblance195 to that intellect, does not also display truth without qualification, but [only] as what is contrary to falsity. For if truth lies in assertion, falsity must ie in denial, so that [our intellect] always has falsity confounded196 with truth, and thought about along with it.
112.14 (430b27-30): When, however, [our intellect] examines one of the uncombined things that are signified,197 and thinks about its form and the definition of its essence, it errs least, though it does not always light upon what is [true]. Instead like vision, which errs least in judging only the white thing, but errs frequently in asserting that the white thing is Cleon,198 [our] intellect is also in most cases unerring and correct as long as it restricts itself to just the thought of the essence (e.g., to that of the good or of the fine). But when it says that one thing is good and another fine, it frequently makes the wrong assignment,199 and transfers such qualities to things that are not of that sort,200 and in just such cases there is considerable falsity and error. It ought, then, to restrict itself to the forms and above all seek out those without matter,201 as the special function of the intellect concerns these.202

This is what  avoidance or appetite, when actual, really  means, and the faculties of appetite or avoidance  are not really different from each other, or  from the sensitive faculty, though their essence  is different.

There is some science which theorizes the being as being and the things belonging to this with respect to itself. 
This is the same as none of those speaking in a partial way. 
None of the other [sciences] universally concerning the being *as* being, but cutting off some part of it theorize concerning this the accidental, such as the mathematical sciences 
But since we seek the beginnings and the highest causes, it is clear that these are of some nature with respect to itself. 
If therefore also those seeking the elements of the beings sought these same beginnings, it is necessary also that the elements be of the being not accidentally but *as* being. 
Therefore also the first causes of the being *as* being are to be accepted by us.

[My translation] 

{INTRODUCTION} 
{being} {being as being} 
[TRANSLATION of Sachs] 
There is a kind of knowledge that contemplates what is insofar as it is, and what belongs to it in its own right. And this is not the same as any of those that are spoken of as partial, since none of the other kinds of knowledge examines universally what pertains to being as being, but cutting off some part of it, they consider this attribute, as do the mathematical kinds of knowledge.. But since we aer seeking the sources and highest causes, it is clear that they must belong to some nature in its own right. So if also those who were weeking the elements of beings were in quest of these sources, the elements too must belong to what is, not incidentally but insofar as it is. For this reason, for us too it is the first causes of being as being that must be gotten hold of.

[Sachs] But if being and oneness are one and    the same nature in that they follow upon  one   another, as do source and cause, thought  not   as being revealed in a single articulation    (though it makes no difference even if we   do  understand them alike, but is even more   convenient)---for  "one human bieng" and "a   human being that is"  and "a human being"  are  the same thing, and  nothing different  is revealed  by the redoubled  statement that  the human  being is one or that  the human  being that  is one *is* and it is  clear that  they are  distinct with respect to  either  coming into  being or passing away and  similarly  with oneness,  so that obviously the  addition  in these statements  signifies the  same thing,  and what is one  is nothing different  aside  from whats, while  further the thinghood  of  each thing is not  incidental but is likewise   the very thing  that something is--therefore,   just as many  forms as there are of oneness,   so many also  are there of being. It belongs   to a kind of  knowledge that is generically   the same to  consider what pertains to what   there are;  I mean, for example, about sameness   and similarity  and other such things. And  just  about all  opposites lead back to this  starting  point;  but let these have been examined  by  us in  the passages about contraries.

[SACHS] Here is a sign of this: those who engage in dialectic and the sophists slip into the same outward appearance as the philosopher. For sophistry is wisdom in appearance only, while dialectic discourses about everything, being is common to all things, so it is clear that they discourse about these topics just because they are proper to philosophy; for sophistry and dialectic trun themselves to the same class of things as philosophy, but it differes from one of them in the way its power is turned, and from the other in the choice of a way of life it makes; dialectic is tentative about those things that philosophy seeks to know, and sophistry is a seeming without a being.

<@314.24@ CHAPTER 3 
{INTRODUCTION} 
[Sachs] One must discuss whether it belongs to one kind of knowledge or to different ones to be concerned with things that are called axioms in mathematics as well as with thinghood.

THE ANSWER SEEMS TO be that they both belong to {philosophy} {SCOPE}, insofar as philosophy is concerned with what belongs to all beings.

{SUMMARY} 
This is the case at least with the geometer or arithmetician; neither say anything about the "common" axioms. 
The {physicist} however does say something about them, since: 
[SACHS] The study of nature is a kind of wisdom too, but not the primary one. However much some of those who speak about truth try to say in what way one much receive it, they do this through a lack of education in the arts of logical analysis; for one must arrive already knowing about these things, and not find them out while studying.

{nature} {physics} 

{truth} 
[Sachs] So that the one who knows about being as being would be able to state the most certain sources of all things. And this is the philosopher. And the most certain of all principles is that about which it is impossible to be in error; for such a principle must be the best known (since all people are deceived about things they do not know) and nonhypothetical. For that which is necessary for one who understands any of the beings whatever to have is not a {hypothesis} {EXPLANATION}; and that which is necessary for him to arrive having.

THIS PRINCIPLE {archē} is the most certain {bebaiotatos} 

THIS PRINCIPLE = {non-contradiction} {logic} 
It is not possible for the same thing at the same time both to belong and not belong to the saem thing in the same respect...For it is impossible for anyone at all to conceive the same thing to be and not be, as some people thing Heracleitus says. 
For it is not necessary that someone take what he says into his understanding. 
AN {ultimate opinion}

<@314.25@ CHAPTER 4 {SUMMARY} 
Some do not accept the principle of non-contradiction, claiming that it is possible for the same thing to be and not be, and also claim that it is possible to conceive of something this way. 
We have argued that this is possible, and the {non-contradiction} is the most certain of all principles.

Yet want a demonstration of this. This is due to lack of education; it is lack of education not to know of what one ought to seek a demonstration and of what one ought not...

There cannot be a demonstration of everything {infinite regress} 
NEVERTHELESS; a kind of demonstration by {refutation} of {non-contradiction} is possible. 
WHAT follows is an intricate demonstration by refutation, which hinges upon the idea that whoever presents an argument against the principle of non-contradiction, and has actually said something rather than nothing, and *meant* {meaning} something in saying something, he will come into contradiction with himself, since he meant something determinate, yet what he is claiming denies the possibility of determinate meaning.

"Furthermore, the one who concedes this has conceded that something is true without demonstration"

[Sachs] And the starting point for all such arguments is not the demand that one say something either to be or not to be (for perhaps one might suppose that this would require from the outset the thing to be shown), but that what he says must *mean* something to both himnself and someone else, for this is necessary, if he is going to say anything. For if this is not the case, there would be no argument with such a person, neither by himself in relation to himself, nor with anyone else. But if someone grants this, there will be a demonstration, for there will already by something determinate {orismenon}. But the one responsible for it is not the one demonstrating but the one who submits to it, for while doing away with reason he submits to reason. Furthermore, the one who concedes this has conceded that something is true without demonstration

THE ARGUMENT: 
1) If someone says anything at all they must *mean* something to themselves and to someone else.

2) If someone says nothing, there is no argument with them; they are like a plant 

3) IF (1), then they have said something definite, words "be" and "no be" have a definite meaning. 
(4) Further, suppose that, if "human being" signifies something definite, it is "two-footed definition" 

(5) {DEFINITION} signifying one thing = "If this is a human being, then if anything is a human being, this will be its human-being "

"For it is not possible to think without thinking one thing, so if thinking is possible, one could set down one name for this thing." 
i.e. : if thinking is possible at all, then words have defininite meaning...

THIS gets at the most fundamental point...The intertwinement of {truth} and {being}...The definiteness of meaning depends on the {logic}al {principle} of {non-contradiction}...

But this in turn is bound up with {ontology}; to deny {non-contradiction} not only destroys the possibility of truth, but of being...

The one destruction and the other are the same...

// 
IN a way, this returns Aristotle to the Parmendian premise, yet, unlike {Plato}, and unlike {Parmenides}, he does not conceive of this foundational logic as some sort of {truth} to which we need special access, or a kind of demonstration...The basic possibility of truth is bound up with, and structures, the realm of ordinary opinion.

But if the very thing that it is to be human is the same as the very thing that it is either not to be human or to be not human, then something else *would* be the being of it, so that they would have to say that nothing has any such defining articulation, but all things are incidental; for in this respect thinghood and what is incidental are distinguished.

<@314.26@ CHAPTER 5 {SUMMARY} 
THE prounouncement of {Protagoras} ["A human being is the measure of all things---of the things that are, that they are, and of the things that are not, that they are not"] 
is a consequence of the opinion treated in the previous section, "for if all opinions and appearances are true, it is necessary that all things be at the same time both true and false" = {relativism/position} 
And yet the approach Aristotle will take to refute this opinion is very different. "for some people need persuasion while others need brute force" 
Those who believe this because they are at an impasse are easy to cure; but for whose who are for the sake of arguing, the remedy is a reducation of their exact vocal and verbal argument.

THOSE who are at an impasse take their departure from perception, since contradictories and contraries are present at the same time.

IN RESPONSE to these: they are in some way right, in some way wrong. Being is said in two ways; "so that there is a way in which it is possible for something to come into being out of what is not, and a way in whcih it is not,..." 
{potentiality} {actuality} {DIFFERENCE} 
{Democritus} {Empedocles} {Parmenides} {Anaxagoras} 
It is very troubling then that even these philosophers have come to this opinion; is the pursuit of {truth} futile.

YET THESE opinions can be explained from the fact that they assumed that the only beings were perceptible things. 
And moreover they saw everything as being in {motion} 
Leading to the opinions of the {Heracliteans/school} such as {Cratylus/philosopher} 
To resolve these difficulties: "to change in quantity is not the same as to change what sort of thing something is, so letting something not stay constant with respect to size, we will recognize everything on account of its form" 
Those with this opinion about {becoming} nevertheless deserve to be censored, since they extend this opinion to the whole {universe} 
Draws a distinction between {appearance} and {perception} 
Also introduces the concept of the {authoritative} -- The opinion of a doctor regarding the future, or of one sense over another. 
"But not even at a different time does one of the senses disagree about the *attribute*, but only about that to which the attribute belongs.

"

This even applies to taste..."but the sweetness itself, such as it *is* whenever it might be present, never changes" {compare@Locke} 
REJECTION of {idealism} vis a vis {primary ousia} 
"And in general, if all there is is what is perceptible, nothing would be if there were not beings with souls, since there would be no sense perceptions. Now that there would be neither sense objects nor sense perceptions is perhaps true (for these are experiences of the perceiver), but it is impossible that there not be the underlying things which bring about sense perception, even without the perception. For the perception itself is sure not *of* itself, but there is also something else besides the perception, which must be prior to the perception"

As a consequence of the same opinion, there is also the pronouncement of {Protagoras}, and they must both alike either be so or not be so; for if all opinions and appearances are true, it is necessary that all things be at the same time both {true} and {false} (for many people conceive of things that are contrary to one another, and consider those who do not believe the same things as themselves to be wrong, so that the same thing must both be and not), and if this is so, all opinions must be true (for people who are wrong and those who are right believe things opposite to one another, so if things are this way, everything is right).

ὥστ’ ἀνάγκη τὸ αὐτὸ εἶναί τε καὶ μὴ εἶναι), καὶ εἰ τοῦτ’ ἔστιν, ἀνάγκη τὰ δοκοῦντα εἶναι πάντ’ ἀληθῆ (τὰ ἀντικείμενα γὰρ δοξάζουσιν ἀλλήλοις οἱ διεψευσμένοι καὶ ἀληθεύοντες· εἰ οὖν ἔχει τὰ ὄντα οὕτως, ἀληθεύσουσι πάντες). ὅτι μὲν οὖν ἀπὸ τῆς αὐτῆς (15) εἰσὶ διανοίας ἀμφότεροι οἱ λόγοι, δῆλον· ἔστι δ’ οὐχ ὁ αὐτὸς τρόπος πρὸς ἅπαντας τῆς ἐντεύξεως· οἱ μὲν γὰρ πει- θοῦς δέονται οἱ δὲ βίας. ὅσοι μὲν γὰρ ἐκ τοῦ ἀπορῆσαι ὑπέλαβον οὕτως, τούτων εὐΐατος ἡ ἄγνοια (οὐ γὰρ πρὸς τὸν λόγον ἀλλὰ πρὸς τὴν διάνοιαν ἡ ἀπάντησις αὐτῶν)· ὅσοι (20) δὲ λόγου χάριν λέγουσι, τούτων δ’ ἔλεγχος ἴασις τοῦ ἐν τῇ φωνῇ λόγου καὶ τοῦ ἐν τοῖς ὀνόμασιν 
So it is clear that both of these arguments are consequences of the same thinking. But the same way of going about things is not possible in every encounter; for some people need persuasion while others need brute force. For all those who believe this way from being at an impasse in thought, their ignorance is easy to cure (for the engagement is not with their argument but with their thinking), but for those who argue for the sake of arguing, the remedy for them is a refutation of their exact vocal and verbal argument.

In the second case, the mistaken thinking that underlies the argument will be confronted...

The mistaken thinking underlying the argument results from failing to distinguish between {perception} and that which underlies perception. Failing to recongize that being is meant in two ways ---potentiality and actuality.

And people also say that Homer seemed to have this opinion, because he made Hector, when he was knocked out by a blow, lie "thinking changed thoughts," as though even those who are delirious are thinking, just not the same things. So it is clear that, if both are processes of thinking, the beings too are at the same time so and not so. And it is in this respect that what follows is most harsh: for if those who most of all have seen the truth that is accessible--and these are those who seek it most and love it most---if they have such opinions and declare these things about truth, how will this not be enough to make those who are trying to philosophize lose heart? For seeking the truth would be a wild goose chase

Now the cause of their opinion is that they were inquiring into the truth about beings, but they assumed that the only beings were perceptible things; but amogn these the nature of the indeterminate is heavily present, and the sort of being that we described. 
For this reason, while they speak reasonably, they do not speak the truth.

That they do not really believe it is obvious; at any rate no one, even if he thinks he is in Athens one night when he is in Libya, goes to the Athenian town hall. And about the future, too, as Plato says, surely the opinion of the doctor and that of an ignorant person are not alike authoritative about say, who is or is not going to get well. Further, among the sense themselves, the perception of an alient or a proper attribute are not alike authoriative, nor are those by a similar sense and the proper sense itself, but about color, sign is authoritative, not taste, and about flavor, taste is, not sight, each of which at the same time about the same thing never sense that it is simultaneously so and not so.

[Sachs] For these people insist that there be a justification of everything {logon}; for they ask for a starting point {archē} and want to get hold of it through demonstration {apodeixis/gr} when the fact that tehy are not convinced of their own doubts is obvious in their actions. INstead, the very thing we are saying is the condition they are in {pathos}, for they are looking for a reason for what has no reason, since the starting point of demonstration is not demonstration.

With this passage, Aristotle has managed to reconcile what seems to be conflicting positions about whether perception is simply true, or neither true or false...

Appearance is simply {true} to the one for whom it appears, as it appears...THIS is the phenomenological level of disclosure...
 Needless to say {compare@Heidegger} this is key to Heidegger's account in {Being and Time/book} 
// {strata} 
These strata are not the same as MODES of truth...Rather: we could say that FOR Aristotle these strata of truth are a way of organizing the {modes} of truth...A kind of {ordering} of the modes of {truth}...

BUT ultimately...AND this is the point of my book: the politico-speculative ordering, achieved via neoplatonism and Christianity, will win out over Aristotle's approach...
Could we say that that Aristotle distinguishes between the {political} and the {speculative} {ordering}, rather than conflating them...

<@314.27.3@ But if it is not the case that everything is relative, but some things are themselves in their own right, then not everything that appears would be true. For what appears is an appearance to something, so that the one who says that all appearances are true makes all beings relative. And for this reason, those who are looking for the brute force of argument, and at the same time insist on putting forth a reason, ought to beware, since it is not the appearance that is true, but the appearance to the one it appears to, and when it appears and in what respect and how.

[Sachs] But neither is it possible that there be anything between contradictories, but about any one thing whatever it is necessary either to affirm or deny one of them. 
This is evident first of all to those who define what the true or false are. For to say that what is is not or that what is not is, is false, but to say that what is is and what is not is not, is true, so that the one who says that something is or is not is either right or wrong. But there is no middle ground, niether what is nor what is not is said either to be or not to be.

TWO QUESTIONS ASSUME THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE: (1) Why does Aristotle never really define truth is an explicit way...but rather, he speaks about the use of truth...

(2) Why does Aristotle never (to the best of my knowledge) say that "truth is spoken in many ways" 
// My intuition: Aristotle sees clearly that the question of truth establishes the outermost horizon of thinking. No proper definition could be given of truth...It is even more {transcendental} than being...

[Sachs] But the starting point for all of these comes from definition. And the definition arises from the necessity that they mean something, since the articulation of which the word is a sign will be a definition. But while the Heraclitean account {Heraclitus}, saying that everything is and is not, seemed to make all things be true, that of {Anaxagoras}, that there is something between contradictories, seems to make all things false, for when things are mixed, the mixture is neither good nor not-good, so that there is nothing true to say.

// THE definition is {logos} ; the {name} {onoma} is a sign {sēeinon/gr} of the logos.

SO the name signifies {signification} the definition...

<@314.29@ CHAPTER 8 {SUMMARY} 
THIS final chapter of book gamma of the Metaphysics seems to offer a summary of the entire argument up to this point.

The fundamental conclusion: one-sided statements with general application--all things are true, all things are false--cannot be accepted in the way people say them. 

HENCE: one also cannot say that {Heraclitus} that " all things are true " and "all things are false" 
Since if each is impossible, so is the conjunction.

CONFRONTED with such claims one must simply insist simply that words means something. "so that one must reason from a definition to grasp what would mean something false or something true" 
"And if what is true to assert is what is false to deny, it is impossible for all things to be false, since one of the two parts of the contradiction must be true" = SO in other words: if one means that something is false, one also mneans that something is true.

Moreover, if is is necessary to either (1) assert everything or (2) deny everything, then either (1) or (2) false; both cannot be false.

"For the one who says that everything is true also makes the statement contrary to his own to be true, so that his own is not true" 
NOR can one make just one exception, because if this exception is true, the statement that it is true is also true, ad infinitum {infinite regress/proof} 
AND FURTHERMORE, this leads to a conclusion about {physics}..."For if all things are at rest, the same things would always be true and the same things false, but this obviously changes, but if all things are in motion, nothing would be true and therefore everything would be false, but it has been demonstrated that this is impossible." 
AND FINALLY the cosmological conclusion: "But it is surely not everything that is at rest sometimes and in motion sometimes, while nothing is always at rest or in motion, for there is something that is always moving the things that move, and the first mover itself is motionless." {prime mover}

[Sachs] But in the face of all such claims one must require what was said in the chapters above, not that something be or not be so but that it *mean* something, so that one must reason from a definition to grasp what would mean something false or something true. And if what is true to assert is what is false to deny, it is impossible for all things to be false, since one of the two parts of the contradiction must be true. Further, if it is necessary either to assert or deny everything, it is impossible for all things to be false, since one of the two parts of the contradiction must be true.

Now a statement is false which is about things that are not, insofar as it is false, for which reason every statement is false about something other than that about which it is {true}, as what is true of the circle is false about the triangle. And of each thiung there is a sense in whcih there is one statement, which say what it is for it to be, but there is another sense in whcih there are many statements, since the thing itself and thing when it has been affected are in a certain way the same, such as Socrates and the educated Socrates (but a false statement is not a statement about anything simply). 
πράγματα μὲν οὖν ψευδῆ οὕτω λέγεται, ἢ τῷ μὴ εἶναι αὐτὰ ἢ τῷ (25) τὴν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν φαντασίαν μὴ ὄντος εἶναι· λόγος δὲ ψευ- @1 δὴς ὁ τῶν μὴ ὄντων, ᾗ ψευδής, διὸ πᾶς λόγος ψευδὴς ἑτέ- ρου ἢ οὗ ἐστὶν ἀληθής, οἷον ὁ τοῦ κύκλου ψευδὴς τριγώνου.
ἑκάστου δὲ λόγος ἔστι μὲν ὡς εἷς, ὁ τοῦ τί ἦν εἶναι, ἔστι δ’ ὡς πολλοί, ἐπεὶ ταὐτό πως αὐτὸ καὶ αὐτὸ πεπονθός, οἷον Σω- (30) κράτης καὶ Σωκράτης μουσικός (ὁ δὲ ψευδὴς λόγος οὐθενός ἐστιν ἁπλῶς λόγος)· [I've included the Greek for the conclusion of the first definitions, since the transition is important] 

For this reason Aristhenes believed simplemindedly that nothing was fit to be said except a thing's own articulation, one statement for one thing, from which it followed that there could be no contradicting, and practically no making a mistake.

But it is possible to speak of each thing not only by its articulation but also by that of something else, and this either completely falsely, or it is possible in a way also truly, as eight is called doubt by means of the articulation of two.

{definition@2.1} = {logical} truth of the {definition} itself. The {statement} {logos} of the {ti hēn einai/syntagm} 
{definition@2.2} [THESE aren't really so clearly separated though] = {logical} truth of statements said about the {accidents} of something 
// If, as for {Aristhenes/philosopher} only the statement of the articulation is the only thing fit to be said, then nothing would be falsely said. [Every definition is either completely true, or misses its mark so much that it is not even false...]

and a false human being is one who skillfully and deliberately makes use of such statements., for no other reason but for its own sake, and who foists such statements onto other people, in the same way that we also said that things are false which produce a false appearance. 
For this reason the arguement in the {Hippias/Socratic dialogue=dialogue=text} goes wrong in saying tha tthe same person is {false} and {true}. For it takes the one who is capable of deceiving as being false (and this is the one who knows and has understanding) and further assumes that the one who willingly does low things is better than one who does so unwillingly. But this takes something false out of a surver of examples, for the one who limps willingly is better off than the one who does so unwillingly if limping means imitating a limp, since if one is in fact willingly lame he is perhaps worse off, just as in the case of moral character, so this one too.

[Sachs] There is a certain principle in beings about which it is not possible to be mistaken, but always necessary to do the opposite, and I mean to attain the truth, and it is of this sort: that it is impossible for the same thing at one and the same time to be and not to be, and for the other things that are opposite to each other in that way to belong to it.

THE ARGUMENT GIVEN HERE SEEMS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN {compare@Metaphysics Gamma}...

It is necessary then for each of the words to be intelligible and to mean something, not many things but only one, but if it does mean more than one thing, it is necessary to make clear to which of these one is applying the word. So the one one who say "this is and is not" denies that which he says, and so he denies that this word means what it means, which is impossible. So if being-this means something, it is impossible for the contradiction to be true.

_ὁ δὴ λέγων εἶναι τοῦτο καὶ μὴ εἶναι, τοῦτο ὅ φησιν οὔ φησιν, ὥσθ’ ὃ σημαίνει τοὔνομα τοῦτ’ οὔ φησι σημαίνειν· τοῦτο δ’ ἀδύνατον. ὥστ’ εἴπερ σημαίνει τι τὸ εἶναι τόδε, τὴν ἀντίφασιν ἀδύνατον ἀληθεύειν. ἔτι δ’ εἴ τι σημαίνει τοὔνομα καὶ τοῦτ’ ἀληθεύεται, δεῖ τοῦτ’ ἐξ ἀνάγκης (20) εἶναι· τὸ δ’ ἐξ ἀνάγκης ὂν οὐκ ἐνδέχεταί ποτε μὴ εἶναι·

<@321@ THE DISCUSSION OF {Truth} in Metaphysics Theta,  book 9, chapter 10... 

And since being and not being are meant in  one sense  by reference to the various ways  of attributing being,  and in another by reference  to the potency or being-at-work  of these or  their opposites, but the most governing  sense  is the true or the false, and since this as   applied to particular things depends on combining   or separating, in such a way that one who  thinks  what is separated is separated and  what is combined  is combined thinks truly,  but one who thinks these  things to be opposite  to the way the things are things  falsely,  when is what is spoken of as truth or falsity   present or not present? For it is necessary  to examine  in what way we mnean this. For  you are not pale because  we think truly that  you are pale, but rather it is  because you  are pale that we who say so speak the  truth.  So if some things are always combined and   incapable of being separated, while other are  always  separate and incapable of being combined,  then others  admit of opposites (for being  something is being-combined  and being-one,  while not being it is not being combined  but  being more than one).   
Concerning the ones that admit of opposites,  then,  the same opinion and the same statement  come to be  false and true, and it is possible  for someone at  one time to think truly and  at another time to think  falsely; but about  the ones that are incapable of  being otherwise,  nothing comes to be at one time  true, at another  time false, but the same things  are always  true and false.

<@321.1.1@ {Joe Saches/author} NOTES in a {footnote} 

This is a dialectical step beyong what is said in Bk. IV, ch. 4. Being as the true was there set aside as not the governing sense of being, since it belonged only to thinking and didn't reveal any new kind of being. Books VII-IX have revealed the being of everything in our sensory experience, and the dependence of it all upon the being-at-work of forms to make things whole. But that leads to the question of how being should be understood when there is no division into "categories" no potency and no wholeness out of the parts. This is a shift to a more primitive and original sense of truth as emergence out of hiddenness, which has been antiicipated at the end of Bk II. Ch. 1.

<@321.2@ But not for things that are not compound, what is being or not being, and the true and the false? 

Rather, just as the {true} {truth} is not the same for these things, so too {being} is not the same for them {RELATION}, but the true or false is this: touching and affirming something uncompounded is the true (for affirming is not the same thing as asserting a predication), while not touching is being ignorant (for it is not possible to be deceived about what it is, except incidentally). 

περὶ δὲ δὴ τὰ ἀσύνθετα τί τὸ εἶναι ἢ μὴ εἶναι καὶ τὸ ἀληθὲς καὶ τὸ ψεῦδος; οὐ γάρ ἐστι σύνθετον, ὥστε εἶναι μὲν ὅταν συγκέηται, μὴ εἶναι δὲ ἐὰν διῃρημένον ᾖ, ὥσπερ τὸ λευκὸν  ξύλον ἢ τὸ ἀσύμμετρον (20) τὴν διάμετρον· οὐδὲ τὸ ἀληθὲς καὶ τὸ ψεῦδος ὁμοίως ἔτι ὑπάρ τὴν διάμετρον· οὐδὲ τὸ ἀληθὲς καὶ τὸ ψεῦδος ὁμοίως ἔτι ὑπάρ- ξει καὶ ἐπ’ ἐκείνων. ἢ ὥσπερ οὐδὲ τὸ ἀληθὲς ἐπὶ τούτων τὸ αὐτό, οὕτως οὐδὲ τὸ εἶναι, ἀλλ’ ἔστι τὸ μὲν ἀληθὲς ἢ ψεῦδος, τὸ μὲν θιγεῖν καὶ φάναι ἀληθές (οὐ γὰρ ταὐτὸ κατάφασις καὶ φάσις), τὸ δ’ ἀγνοεῖν μὴ θιγγάνειν (ἀπατηθῆναι γὰρ (25) περὶ τὸ τί ἐστιν οὐκ ἔστιν ἀλλ’ ἢ κατὰ συμβεβηκός· ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ περὶ τὰς μὴ συνθετὰς οὐσίας, οὐ γὰρ ἔστιν ἀπατηθῆ- ναι· καὶ πᾶσαι εἰσὶν ἐνεργείᾳ, οὐ δυνάμει, ἐγίγνοντο γὰρ ἂν καὶ ἐφθείροντο, νῦν δὲ τὸ ὂν αὐτὸ οὐ γίγνεται οὐδὲ φθεί- ρεται, ἔκ τινος γὰρ ἂν ἐγίγνετο· 
{thiganein/gr} {touching} {compare@Agamben} 
And it is similar with what concerns independent things that are not compound, since it is not possible to be deceived about them; and they are all at work, not in potency, for otherwise they would be coming into being and passing away, but the veyr thing that *is* does not come to be or pass away, since it would have to come from something. So it is not possible to be deceived about anything the very being of which is at work, but one iether grasps or does not grasp it in contemplative thinking {contemplation} {deception}; after them, inquiring after what they are is asking whether they are of certain kinds or not.

<@321.3@ {truth} {contemplation} {RELATION} 
SO being in the sense of the true, and not-being in the sense of the false, in one way is: if something is combined, it is true, and if it is not combined, it is false. But in one way it is: if something *is* it is present in a certain way, and if it is not present in that way, it is not. The true is the contemplative knowing of these things, and there is no falsity nor deception, but only ignorance, and not the same sort of thing as blindness, for blindness would be as if someone were not to have the contemplative power at all. And it is clear also that about motionless things there can be no deception about when they are so, if one grasps that they are motionless. For if one supposes that the triangle does not change, one will not think that it sometimes has two right angles and sometimes does not; but it is possible that one such thing be a certain way and anohter not (for instance, that no even number is prime), or that some are and some are not. But about a single number, not even this is possible, since one could no longer suppose that one thing is one way and another not, but one thinks truly or falsely that something is always a certain way.

<@324@ Book II, alpha, Chapter 1 And it is also right to call philosophy the knowledge of truth. For the end of contemplative knowledge is truth, but of practical knowledge it is action; for even if people devoted to the active life do examine the way things are, they do not contemplate the cause in its own right, but in relation to something now. But without the cause we do not know the truth, but each thing is what it is most of all, and more so than other things, if as a result of it the same name also belongs to those other things....Therefore also, what is responsible for the being-true of derivative things is more true than they are. For the reason the sources of the things that always *are* must be true in the highest sense (for they are not sometimes true, nor is antyhing a cause for them of their being, but they are the cause of other things), so what each thing has of being, that too it has of truth.

<@324.1@ {REFLECTION} THIS passage is extremely important, since it establishes the fundamental importance of {ontological truth}, of the relation of {truth} and {being} 

{philosophy} is {DEFINITION} defined as the {science} {epistēm/emacrongr} and {praktikē/gr} 

The use of {ergon/gr} here is suggestive: praxis realizes, actualized that which exist only as potentiality, whereas theorizing enters into a relation to what is most fully actualized. 
καὶ γὰρ ἂν τὸ πῶς ἔχει σκοπῶσιν, οὐ τὸ ἀΐδιον ἀλλ’ ὃ πρός τι καὶ νῦν θεωροῦσιν οἱ πρακτικοί. οὐκ ἴσμεν δὲ τὸ ἀληθὲς ἄνευ τῆς αἰτίας 
While the practical people look to how things are, they do not consider the {aidion/gr} [the eternal,everlast] but the "in relation to something " and "now." 
οὐκ ἴσμεν δὲ τὸ ἀληθὲς ἄνευ τῆς αἰτίας· 
[Sachs] But without the cause we do nont know the truth. [IS this the only way to translate: .e.g They do not know the truth apart from the cause] 
This next section however seems to exclude this reading: 
ἕκαστον δὲ μάλιστα αὐτὸ τῶν ἄλλων καθ’ ὃ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ὑπάρχει τὸ συνώνυμον (οἷον τὸ πῦρ θερμότατον· (25) καὶ γὰρ τοῖς ἄλλοις τὸ αἴτιον τοῦτο τῆς θερμότητος)· ὥστε καὶ ἀληθέστατον τὸ τοῖς ὑστέροις αἴτιον τοῦ ἀληθέσιν εἶναι.
διὸ τὰς τῶν ἀεὶ ὄντων ἀρχὰς ἀναγκαῖον ἀεὶ εἶναι ἀληθε- στάτας (οὐ γάρ ποτε ἀληθεῖς, οὐδ’ ἐκείναις αἴτιόν τί ἐστι τοῦ εἶναι, ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖναι τοῖς ἄλλοις), ὥσθ’ ἕκαστον ὡς ἔχει τοῦ (30) εἶναι, οὕτω καὶ τῆς ἀληθείας.

Therefore the truest thing is the cause for subsequent things of their being true.

[Sachs] Therefore also, what is responsible for the being-true of derivative things is more true than they are. [WHY not "most true" ---why comparative, not superlative??] 

// 
The Greek in the TLG reads οὐ τὸ ἀΐδιον ἀλλ’ , the Oxford (which Sachs follows) *ou to aition kath' autho* STRANGE!

The beholding of truth is in one way difficult, but in another way easy. A sign of this is that, while no one happens to be capable of it in an adequate way, neither does anyone miss it, but one says something about nature, and though one by one they add little or nothing to iut, from all of them put together something comes into being with a certain stature. 
LIKE the saying: "Who could miss the doorway?"

If one wer to take only the first of these things, separating it out, that they thought the primary independent things were gods, one would regard this as having been said by divine inspiration, and, since it is likely that every kind of art and philosophy has been discovered to the limit of its potential many times, and passes away in turn, one would consider these opinons of those people to have been saved like holy relics up to now. So the opinion of our forefathers that comes from the first ages is clear to us but only to this extent.

And the course of its life is of such a kind as the best we have for a short time. This is because it is always the same way (which for is impossible), and because its being-at-work {energeia} is also pleasure {ēdonē} 
(which is what makes being awake, perceiving, and thinking the most pleasant things, while hopes and memories are pleasant on account of these). 

And the thinking that is just thinking by itself is a thinking of what is best just as itself, and especially so with what is so most of all.

But by partaking in what it things, the intellect thinks itself, for becomes what it thinks by touching {thigganein/gr} and comtemplating (noein/gr} so that the intellect {nous/gr} and what it thinks {noēton} are the same thing.

For what is receptive {dektikon/gr} of the intellegible {noētos} and thinghood {ousia} is the intellect {nous} and it is at work when it has them; therefore it is the being-at-work rather than the receptivity the intellect has that seeks godlike, and its contemplation is pleasantest and best. So if the divine being is always in this good condition that we are sometimes in, that is to be wondered at,m and if it is in it to a greater degree than we are, that is to be wondered at still more. And that is the way it is. But like belongs to it too, for the being-at-work of intellect is like, and that being *is* being-at-work and its being-at-work is in itself the best life {z/omacrongr} {aristēos/gr} and is everlasting. (aiōn}.

And we say that it is a god who everlastingly lives the best life, so that like and continuous and everlasting duration belong to a god; for this being is god.

<@330@ REGARDING {Richard Rufus}'s reading of Aristotle's {Metaphysics}, as explained by {Silvia Donati/philosopher=academic} in the {Brill Companion to Medieval Commentaries on Aristotle} 
{metaphysical concept} {logical concept} {DIFFERENCE} 
Despite his idea of the indirect predication of being in the case of accidents, Rufus does not want to go so far as to completely reject the traditional classification of an accident as a being ("accidens est ens").
He distinguishes between a metaphysical concept and a logical concept of being and maintains that the metaphysical concept gives a truthful account (modus verus) of reality, whereas the logical concept gives a non-truthful account (modus non verus). This difference between the two concepts is due to their respective objects. The primary object of the metaphysical concept of being is what is primary in reality, namely, the thing that is a being (ens). The primary object of the logical concept of being, by contrast, is what in reality is only secondary, namely, esse, which in reality presupposes something that is. An accident cannot fall under the metaphysical concept of being, since an accident is only an esse of a substance; therefore, in accordance with Aristotle’s characterization in the Metaphysics, the metaphysician describes an accident as "something belonging to a being" ("accidens est entis"), not as a being. An accident can be classified as a being ("accidens est ens") only according to the logical concept of being, which does not give, however, a true account of reality.52 In Rufus’s view, then, the doctrine of the ten categories of being is not a genuinely metaphysical theory but only a logical one, given that only the items in the category of substance fall under the metaphysical concept of being.53

<@330.1@ {Richard Rufus} {Thomas Aquinas} {anological predication} {CONTRAST} 
While Rufus reduces the metaphysical notion of being to that of substance, Aquinas’s interpretation is more respectful of Aristotle’s idea of being as a pollachos legomenon. In his treatment of Aristotle’s doctrine of the pros hen equivocation of being in the Commentary on Met. IV,54 Aquinas introduces a classification of different types of predication that takes into account both the linguistic and the conceptual aspects (nomen, ratio).
He classifies analogical predication as a kind of predication in which the same name is predicated of different things according to definitions that are partly different and partly identical: different insofar as they express the different relationships of secondary analogates to the primary one, identical insofar as the focus of these different relationships is the same, namely, the primary analogate.55 The predication of "being" is the most significant example of analogical predication. Accordingly, "being" is predicated according to definitions that are partly different, insofar as they express the different relationships of the nine accidental categories to substance, and partly identical, insofar as the focus of these different relationships is the same, namely, substance.56 This conceptual dependence at the level of definitions mirrors the ontological dependence of the accidental categories on substance.57 The model for analogical predication used by Aquinas in the Commentary on the Metaphysics is Aristotle’s description of pros hen equivocation as illustrated by the example of the term "healthy": as "healthy" is predicated according to the prior and posterior of an animal, urine and diet in the sense that it is primarily predicated of an animal in which the quality of health exists, and secondarily of urine and diet in virtue of their relationships to the quality of health existing in the animal, so the term "being" is predicated according to the prior and posterior of substance and of accidental categories in the sense that it is primarily predicated of a substance and secondarily of accidental categories in virtue of their relationships to substance. In a well known passage of his earlier commentary on Sent. I, however, Aquinas gives a somewhat different threefold classification of analogy based on the consideration of the linguistic, conceptual, and ontological aspects (nomen, intentio, esse).58 The first mode of analogy concerns the conceptual, but not the ontological level (secundum intentionem tantum, et non secundum esse): it occurs when a single concept represents different things according to the prior and posterior, but the conceptual unity is not based on a common nature inhering in all the analogates, since the property signified by the concept only exists in the primary analogate, whereas the secondary analogates fall under the concept because of their relationships to that property, which is extrinsic to them. This mode of analogy is exemplified by the term "healthy": the concept of being healthy is applied according to the prior and posterior to an animal, diet and urine, but the property of health only exists in the animal. The second mode of analogy concerns the ontological but not the conceptual level (secundum esse et non secundum intentionem): it occurs when a single concept can indifferently represent many things, but the way in which the property signified by the concept is realized in those things is different. This mode of analogy is what, in technical terms, has been labeled "synonymic analogy" by scholars, who also stress its non- Aristotelian―in fact rather Platonic―flavor: it entails strict unity in definition and therefore can be reduced to synonymy, but different degrees of ontological perfection, so that it can also be classified as a kind of analogy.59 For Thomas, it is exemplified by generic terms such as "body": the name "body" is predicated of sublunary corruptible bodies and 58 Cf. Sancti Thomae Aquinatis Scriptum super libros Sententiarum, I, d. 19, q. 5, a. 2, ad 1, ed. Pierre Mandonnet (Paris, 1929), p. 492. For an interpretation of this passage, see E. Jennifer Ashworth, "Analogy and Equivocation in Thirteenth-Century Logic: Aquinas in Context," Mediaeval Studies 54 (1992), 94-135, esp. 122-30; Seung-Chan Park, Die Rezeption der mittelalterlichen Sprachphilosophie in der Theologie des Thomas von Aquin (Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters) 65 (Leiden-Boston-Cologne, 1999), pp. 358-82; and Ashworth, Les Théories, pp. 39-43.
59 See Matteo di Giovanni, "Averroes on the Species of Celestial Bodies," in: Andreas Speer & Lydia Wegener, eds., Wissen über Grenzen. Arabisches Wissen und lateinisches Mittelalter (Miscellanea 
celestial incorruptible bodies according to the same intention of corporeity, i.e., the capability of receiving dimensions, but this conceptual unity is not grounded on a strict ontological unity, since the characteristic of corporeity is realized in different ways in the two kinds of bodies. Following a well established 13th-century interpretation, Thomas stresses the "synonymic" character of this second mode of analogy, for he claims that it is classified as a mode of analogy by the real philosopher, but is reduced to pure univocation by the logician.60 The third mode of analogy―its most significant case is that of being―is something intermediate between the first two. It concerns both the conceptual and the ontological level (secundum intentionem et secundum esse), for it entails a distinction of degrees at both levels: it occurs when (i) one concept represents different things according to the prior and posterior, and (ii) this conceptual unity is based on a common nature existing in all the analogates, but participated in by them according to the prior and posterior.

<@331@ {truth} {Giles of Rome} as explained by {Allesandro D Conti/philosopher} 

{Aquinas} {CONTRAST} 

Many of the 22 questions of the second book are devoted to the notion of truth and the process of understanding.35 Giles defines truth in the same way as Aquinas in his De veritate, veritas est adaequatio intellectus et rei,36 but then interprets this definition in a different manner. When Aquinas speaks of adaequatio intellectus et rei, he tries to embrace and combine into an unique formula and doctrine the two opposite approaches of Anselm and of Aristotle: in his view, truth is really present in both the things and the intellect. In contrast, Giles thinks that truth is in the intellect only and denies that it is really present in the things―so he seems to exclude that the relation of adequation (or correspondence) that holds between the intellect and the things is symmetrical. According to him, truth, conceived as a real relation of correspondence between two objects, is only present in our intellects, not in the things.37 In the latter, a relation of reason is present, since the things are the cause of the existence in the intellect of the real relation of correspondence in which the truth consists.38 Hence, the things are said to be true denominatively in virtue of the truth present in the intellect, and not because of a truth present in them.39 Moreover, a real relation of correspondence is present in the intellect only when it judges in the right way, that is, when it recognizes how things are (or are not) arranged in the world. In fact, the adequate significate of an act of judging of the intellect (as expressed by a true declarative sentence) is distinct from the thing signified by the subject of that sentence.40 Because of Giles’s peculiar interpretation of the notion of adaequatio, to use such a term can somehow hide the lack of symmetry in the relation holding between the (true) intellect and the things―and this fact explains why in his later works (like the Quodlibeta) Giles utilizes the term "assimilation" (assimilatio) instead of "adequation" (adaequatio). Though the (true) intellect corresponds to the things understood because it conforms to them, the things correspond to the intellect not because they conform to it but because the intellect conforms to them.41 The logical results of this choice are the following: (1) there is no truth but in relation to an intellect; (2) truth is an asymmetrical relation, since Giles’s adaequatio is so; and (3) by truly judging about the metaphysical composition of a thing, the intellect becomes similar to that thing.
Although the first conclusion is already present in the writings of Aquinas, Giles attributes to it a different value. According to the supporters of the ontological theory of truth, the relation of a thing to the (divine) intellect was a necessary requisite too: things are true insofar as they are ordered to the (divine) intellect. For Thomas, the truth of a thing includes the entity of that thing and a relation of adequation to the (divine) intellect.
Giles reads this relation to the intellect (whether divine, angelic, or human intellect) in terms of being known by it. As a consequence, in his view, the truth of a thing does includes not its absolute being (or entity) and a relation of adequation to the (divine) intellect but its being known by an intellect and a relation of likeness to the thing itself. Both these elements are present in the intellect (and not in the thing) as in their substrate of existence. For Aquinas, a thing is true if and only if it is actually existent and conformable to its exemplar in the mind of God; for Giles, a thing is true only derivatively, when and as far as it is known by an intellect.
In other words: unlike Thomas, Giles connects the truth of a thing with its essence and therefore with its possible (and not actual) being― according to what he states in his Quaestiones de esse et essentia and in his Quodlibet II, where he equates the esse essentiae with the esse in potentia (ad esse).42 So, paradoxically, a thing can be rightly understood, and thus it can be said (in a derivative way) to be true, even though it is not actually existent outside the soul.43 This close tie between essence and truth is confirmed by what he says in analyzing the notion of adaequatio in relation to the intellect. As we have already seen, in Giles’s opinion, the quiddity (quidditas) of things as expressed by their definitions is the object of our understanding.44 That being said, he affirms many times that the true (verum) is the object of the intellect. Then, in his view, the true is somehow identical to the essence.
The true is the essence itself qua known by the intellect. And the truth (veritas) is the relation of becoming similar to that inheres in an intellect and joins it to an essence by means of the intentional nature of the species intelligibilis. In turn, the adaequatio is threefold, since there are three kinds of intellect at issue. In fact, when it is known by the divine intellect, the essence is understood as the nature of a thing which is apt to be caused by the intellect (apta nata causari ab intellectu). When it is known by the angelic intellect, the essence is understood as the nature of a thing which is apt to be caused by a superior intellect, just as its intelligible species present in the angelic intellect―since both the essence and its intelligible species are caused by the divine intellect. Finally, when it is known by a human intellect, the essence is understood as the nature of a thing which is apt to cause a mental picture in the intellect (apta natua causare similitudinem in intellectu).45 Those essences which are unable to cause any such effects in an intellect are empty and fictitious, like the concept of the chimera.46 These remarks help us to appreciate the peculiar nature of Giles’s adaequatio. It is a relation, and the principle (ratio) itself of the truth. It assumes different values according to the different kinds of intellect to which it is referred. In the case of the angelic and human intellects, the adaequatio is a real relation, while it is a relation of reason in the case of the divine intellect, since the knowledge of the human (and angelic) intellect depends on the thing understood, whereas any possible thing depends on God’s cognition. Although the adaequatio always entails a certain form of similitudo, nevertheless the adaequatio proper to the human intellect is not a standard relation of similarity, as it is asymmetrical and has no fundamentum.47 It is a relation of reproduction (or copying, so to say) rather than a relation of similarity. The intellect must be said to be (or become) similar to the essence understood, when it rightly judges about it. Yet, no essence is said to be similar to its knowledge present in the human intellect, no matter whether adequate or not. This asymmetry originates from the intentional nature of the mental acts of understanding (both simple and complex). Through these acts the intellect tries to bring about a mental replica of the thing understood, which it assumes as the pattern of its act of reproduction.
Since for Giles the truth is the adaequatio intellectus ad rem, one may ask why the simple apprehension of an essence and the act of judging are linked to each other; and why we can properly speak of truth (and falsity) only in the case of an act of judging of our intellect and not in the case of a simple apprehension of the essence of a thing.
As Giles points out,48 it is the apprehension itself of an essence that necessarily gives rise to an act of judging whereby our intellect expresses, in a definition, the metaphysical structure of the essence understood.
Because of its organization, our intellect can get the nature of things, which is simple and unitary in reality, only through its internal composition.
The cause of this is to be found in the modalities of functioning of our intellect, which can grasp only separately the different aspects of a thing that in empirical reality is one and the same.49 The things understood are the standards that guide our intellect in its actions of composition (when it produces an affirmative statement) and division (when it produces a negative statement) about themselves. So, the sense-cognition testifies to the actual existence of a thing; the intellectual abstraction enables us to recognize the type the thing belongs to; but it is by the act of judging that we can think of the inner metaphysical principles of a thing as principles of that thing; their mutual relationships; and the extramental things themselves as bearers of accidental properties.
The process of knowledge, which is aimed at reproducing the internal structure of and the various states connected with the essence of things, can fail to achieve its goal, since in the act of judging our will plays an eminent role.50 The final stage of the process of knowing is therefore different from the sense-cognition and the abstraction (or simple apprehension of an essence), since the latter are totally passive and unintentional, while the former is a voluntary action. As such, the judgment is open to fault. It is in this possibility of an erroneous judgment that the truth is rooted. The idea of Giles, inspired by Aristotle (De anima, Γ 6, 430a28- b6) and Aquinas,51 is that "truth" and "falsehood," properly speaking, are (like the notions of truth and falsehood we have today) antonymous, and where their (paradigmatic) opposition fails, we can speak of truth only in a secondary and derivative sense.52 Sense-cognition and abstraction in a certain way are always true, since no mistake is possible in the simple apprehension of the existence of a thing or in the intellection of its essence. Only if the intellect, through an act of judging, forms a statement about a thing, is it possible to compare our knowledge, as expressed by a declarative sentence, with the thing itself, and so to give rise to the opposite relations of truth and falsehood.53 Giles’s position is, therefore, far from Thomas’s view as stated in the De veritate and in the Summa theologiae, given that he is more faithful to Aristotle than the Dominican Master. If we compare Giles’s remarks on truth in the Commentary on the Sentences (which was written in the same years as the Quaestiones metaphysicales) with Thomas’s conception as developed in his commentary on the same work, the difference between them is still greater. Giles openly criticizes some chief theses of Thomas’s (earlier) doctrine. In his commentary on the Sentences, Aquinas had maintained that the being of the truth is similar to the being of the universal. Giles argues that this thesis is not consistent with Aristotle’s claim that truth is present in the judging intellect as in its own substrate of inherence.54 As he remarks, the term "fundamentum" has a twofold meaning: it designates either the substrate of existence (subiectum) of a thing; or something existing outside the soul which corresponds to and/or is the cause of a certain operation of the intellect. In his opinion, when Thomas says that the universal has its fundamentum in the things existing outside the soul, he speaks of fundamentum in the first of the two senses just mentioned. Because of the parallelism between universality and truth, the same holds for truth. As a consequence, truth is in the things (and not in the intellect) as in its own substrate of existence-a conclusion which is just the opposite of what Aristotle had thought.55 So, at the end of a long passage, Giles restates that things can be said to be true only derivatively, in virtue of the truth present in the intellect, since truth is a quality that has in the intellect its own substrate of inherence. Things can be said to be true only in the sense that in them there is a (partial) conformity to their own metaphysical principles, so that they are truthful, so to say, about themselves. Real truth is nothing but the entity itself of the things.56

In contrast, Giles thinks that truth is in the intellect only and denies that it is really present in the things―so he seems to exclude that the relation of adequation (or correspondence) that holds between the intellect and the things is symmetrical. According to him, truth, conceived as a real relation of correspondence between two objects, is only present in our intellects, not in the things.37 

In the latter, a relation of reason is present, since the things are the cause of the existence in the intellect of the real relation of correspondence in which the truth consists

Hence, the things are said to be true denominatively in virtue of the truth present in the intellect, and not because of a truth present in them.

{assimilation} {adequation} {DIFFERENCE} {TERMINOLOGY} 
Because of Giles’s peculiar interpretation of the notion of adaequatio, to use such a term can somehow hide the lack of symmetry in the relation holding between the (true) intellect and the things―and this fact explains why in his later works (like the Quodlibeta) Giles utilizes the term "assimilation" (assimilatio) instead of "adequation" (adaequatio) 

(1) there is no truth but in relation to an intellect; (2) truth is an asymmetrical relation, since Giles’s adaequatio is so; and (3) by truly judging about the metaphysical composition of a thing, the intellect becomes similar to that thing.

// According to the supporters of the ontological theory of truth, the relation of a thing to the (divine) intellect was a necessary requisite too: things are true insofar as they are ordered to the (divine) intellect. For Thomas, the truth of a thing includes the entity of that thing and a relation of adequation to the (divine) intellect.
Giles reads this relation to the intellect (whether divine, angelic, or human intellect) in terms of being known by it. As a consequence, in his view, the truth of a thing does includes not its absolute being (or entity) and a relation of adequation to the (divine) intellect but its being known by an intellect and a relation of likeness to the thing itself

<@332.1@ {INTRODUCTION} 
That {Aristotle}'s doctrine of {substance} is the centerpiece of his metaphysics, but is notoriously difficult... 
It is seen as an amalgamation of different accounts, developed at different times.

{DEVELOPMENT} 
ON THE ONE HAND: in the {categories} 
In the supposedly early Categories, so the story goes, the canonical or primary substances are particular instances (Socrates) of universal species (the human species), which, with genera, are substances only in a secondary sense. In the supposedly later Metaphysics, by contrast, secondary substance is abandoned, Socrates is treated as a compound of matter and form, and form alone is identified as primary substance. Even within the Metaphysics itself, moreover, distinct strata are discernible, with the celebrated middle books (VII-IX)-die Substanzb¨ucher as a recent anthology revealingly calls them-containing Aristotle’s fully mature views. Since divine substance (God) is not discussed in these books, it is not a crucial part of those views, and so may be safely ignored or downplayed.


{primary ousia} IS IT the {particular} or {form} 
IN THE MIDDLE PPERIOD 
In those same middle books, however, Aristotle claims that primary substances must be both ontologically primary (the fundamental beings) and epistemologically primary (the primary objects of scientific knowledge).
At the same time, he is explicit that universals (specifically, definable universal essences) alone enjoy epistemological primacy, since they are the first principles of the sciences. It seems to follow that primary substances must be universals. But this conclusion he just as firmly rejects. The result is a dilemma of sorts, which I call the Primacy Dilemma. In my view, Aristotle’s attempt to solve it is the central project of his entire epistemology and metaphysics-one that leads him to abandon Platonism and become an Aristotelian 
THE {primacy dillema} Are the {primary substances} universals... 
A distinction is drawn between {epistemological primacy} and {ontological primacy}

<@332.2@ {THESIS} If I am right, the Primacy Dilemma has a key role to play in one of the most portentous episodes in the history of philosophy. That alone would be enough to ensure its importance. But its implications for the interpretation of Aristotle are equally significant. For it is the problem to which the Categories and Metaphysics (as well as many others of Aristotle’s works) constitute what will emerge as a coherent unified response. The Dilemma is as much a challenge to contemporary Aristotle scholarship, therefore, as it was a challenge to Aristotle himself-especially so, indeed, because his response to it so crucially involves his theology

<@332.3@ {METHOD} {holism} 
I would be guilty of false modesty, however, if I did not also say this.
Many of the individual texts I discuss-especially when taken in isolation-certainly admit of interpretations other than the ones I defend, and many of those I cite pretty much as proof texts have this status only when taken together with other texts similarly treated. Such holism must surely be any reader’s default position. Hence, though each individual interpretation I propose may be controversial when taken by itself, it is immensely strengthened by the fact that it fits into a unified reading of a large number of texts, drawn from a wide variety of Aristotle’s works, which can be seen as addressing a single problem in a philosophically perspicuous way. Piecemeal criticism, as a consequence, is unlikely to do much to threaten my views. Indeed, piecemeal interpretation, often taking the form of a near obsessive focus on a few texts, is precisely what I want to challenge. To see Aristotle right, we need-daunting as the prospect may be-to see him whole.

<@332.4@ {METHOD} {holism} {developmentalism} {DIFFERENCE} 
Holism needn’t be incompatible, of course, with the view that an author’s thought develops over time and so may contain fundamental changes in doctrine, and real or apparent inconsistencies. But holism is to some degree in tension with such developmentalism-especially when, as in the case of Aristotle, independent dating of texts is difficult or impossible, so that developmentalist hypotheses largely piggyback on interpretative ones.
If one can uncover doctrinal unity in such an oeuvre, therefore, developmentalism’s role is diminished. No doubt some of Aristotle’s writings do represent earlier stages of his thought than others, but on the central metaphysical and epistemological questions with which I am concerned, I see little evidence of any fundamental changes of mind. For me, then, issues of chronology are of relatively little significance, and I have usually said nothing about them. Rather, I have written as if Aristotle’s metaphysics were a single, atemporal entity contained in the totality of the texts that make up the Corpus Aristotelicum. With appropriate caveats and provisos, some of which I have entered explicitly, that is what my researches seem to me to have revealed it to be.

These texts merit our (guarded) attention as inspired by Aristotle, if nothing else.

<@332.6@ CHAPTER ONE {chaptertitle@Platonism} 
{substance} as the key to {being} for Aristotle. But what is {substance} 
To what he regards as a perennial question of metaphysics Aristotle returns a lapidary answer: "Indeed what was long ago pursued, is now, and always will be a source of problems-the question what is being (to on)? is just the question what is substance (ousia1)?" (Met. VII 1 1028b2-4). Substance, then, is the key to being. The key to substance is another matter, but a necessary condition (at least) of substancehood is not in doubt: "If one does not suppose the substances to be separated, and in the way that among the beings the particulars are said to be, one will destroy substance as we wish to speak [of it]" (XIII 10 1086b16-19). Separation (chˆoriston), then, must be our first topic.2 
{separation} {chōriston/gr} 

For Aristotle, substance is {separable}; nothing else is, since it is said of substance as subject {hupokeimenon/gr} 

THE separation of substances involves three things.

By parity of reasoning, the separation of substances should involve at least three things: being separate from attributes; not being predicated of them; and being ontologically independent of them. We shall look at these in turn

<@332.7@ {chōtiston} {MEANING} 
[###] Aristotle usually characterizes substances as separate tout court, not as separate from something.5 Nonetheless, the very meaning of chˆoriston, which is formed from chˆorizein (‘to separate’), carries the implication that there is such a thing. Why, then, does Aristotle appear to cancel that implication? The natural explanation is surely this. Attributes are all the beings besides substances, so that substances, in being separate from them, are separate from everything else. Hence there is simply no need to specify what in particular they are separate from.

<@332.9@ {Plato} {Aristotle} {DIFFERENCE} 
On an ante rem (or Platonist) theory of attributes, attributes can exist uninstantiated by particulars. On an in re theory, like Aristotle’s, they cannot: "if everyone were well, health would exist but not sickness, and if everything were white, whiteness would exist but not blackness" (Cat. 11 14a7-10)

<@332.10@ {substance} {attribute} {RELATION} 
[#####] Substances can exist, then, whether or not their attributes exist through being instantiated by something else. Attributes, on the other hand, cannot exist unless they are instantiated by Aristotelian substances, since such substances are (in Aristotle’s view) the only ultimate subjects of predication.
The separation of substance from attributes is not only intelligible, therefore, but entirely of a piece with their inseparability from it.

[#/#] 
subtances are prior to attributes 
BUT THERE ARE also three other kinds of priority of substance.

[##] 
1) priority in account and in knowledge 
2) priority in time 
[#####] NOT SIMPLE TEMPORAL priority [#######] If priority in time were such simple temporal priority, however, substances would have to be able to exist before their attributes. But that, as we saw, is not possible. For though substances can exist whether or not their attributes are instantiated by other things, they cannot exist without attributes themselves.

Priority in time seems, therefore, to be the sort of priority exhibited by F to G, when F is (part of ) the explanation of the temporal phenomenon of G’s coming-into-being.

It this is the most significant result for our purposes-that what is prior in time need not preexist what it is prior to.

Similarly, matter (or the material cause) is prior in time to the compound of matter and form. But that does not entail that it existed before the compound did. For the heavens themselves are compounds of matter-primary body or form.14 Since they are eternal, however, their matter cannot exist before they do.

<@332.16@ {CONCLUSION} of section 1.1 
At the end of the day, then, what we have discovered is this. To be a substance is to be separate from attributes (that is, all nonsubstances), and so to be ontologically independent of-or prior in substance to-them. Being separate, in turn, entails being prior in nature (in both senses of the phrase) and entails (and is entailed by) being prior in account, knowledge, and time. Substance is thus ontologically primary and also epistemologically primary. When substance is analyzed into form and matter, however, the issue of which of them is the focus of the various sorts of primacy also becomes important, and with it the issue of which of them might be prior to the others in at least some of the ways in which they are prior to attributes. But that is a topic we cannot adequately discuss until Aristotle’s own analysis of substance has been further explored.

<@332.17@ {section@1.2} {sectiontitle@Platonic Forms} 
Separation is the hallmark of Aristotle’s substances. It is likewise the Aristotelian hallmark of Platonic forms 

Hence, in Aristotle’s view at least, separate forms are the offspring of a Heraclitean view about perceptibles (they are in flux) and a Socratic view about scientific knowledge (its first principles are definitions of universal essences). Whether he is right about this is another matter, but we needn’t worry about it. Our focus is Aristotle and how he understood Plato, not in whether he was right to understand him as he did.21 
{Heraclitus} {Socrates} 
[#######] Met. XIII 4 1078b12-32 The belief in forms came about in those who spoke about them, because, in regard to truth, they were persuaded by the Heraclitean argument that all perceptibles are always in flux, so that if scientific knowledge is to be of anything, there must, in their view, be some different natures, over and above perceptibles, which are permanent; for there is no scientific knowledge of things in flux. Socrates occupied himself with the virtues of character, and in connection with them became the first to raise the problem of universal definitions....It was reasonable that Socrates should seek the essence (to ti estin). For he was seeking to deduce, and essence (to ti estin) is the first principle of deductions....For there are two things that may be fairly ascribed to Socrates-inductive arguments and universal definition, both of which are concerned with a first principle of scientific knowledge. But Socrates did not separate the universals or the definitions. His successors, however, did separate them, and these were the kinds of beings they called forms.

What is "most extreme" about this Heraclitean opinion is that it involves a denial of the principle of noncontradiction: "[from] the views of Heraclitus ...it would follow that opposites would be predicated of the same thing" (XI 6 1063b24-26).23 For what is altering in every way, and so is always changing from F into not-F, is "no more (ouden mallon)" F than not-F (XII 5 1062b2-7), and so is thought to be both equally.24

Moreover, the Platonists were right to follow Socrates on scientific knowledge. For Aristotle himself believes that the first principles of a science are definitions of universal essences (2.1). Since universals are not identical to particulars, the Platonists were for this reason, too, on the side of the angels in treating forms as distinct from perceptibles. It was only in treating them as separate, then, that they went too far.

<@332.20@ {CONCLUSION} As (would-be) particular substances, forms are ultimate subjects of predication that enjoy ontological priority. As (would-be) universal essences, they also enjoy epistemological priority. As both ontologically and epistemologically prior to perceptible substances, however, forms are also separate from them. And that renders them problematic: separation is "responsible for the problems that arise with the forms" (Met. XIII 10 1086b6-7).

<@332.21@ {INTRODUCTION} {sectiontitle@Problems with Platonic Forms} 
A particular is something there can be only one of, whereas a universal is "by nature such as to belong to many things" (Met. VII 13 1038b11-12). It follows, Aristotle claims, that universals cannot be separate from their instances: "What is one cannot be in many places at once, but what is common [a universal] exists in many places at once; so clearly no universal occurs apart from particulars and separate" (VII 16 1040b25-27). It is because of what universals essentially are, then, that they can exist only in particulars. Aristotle’s in-re-ism about them is based on precisely that.
Forms, however, as particulars themselves, can exist separately. How then can each of them also be a universal-a one over many? This problem about the nature of universals and their relation to particulars-the oneover- many problem, as it has come to be called-continues to be at the center of the debate between nominalists, Platonists, and Aristotelian realists about universals.26 But for that very reason it is not a decisive objection to Platonism 
{one-over-many/aporia} 
A second problem that Aristotle lays at the door of separation is presented in the famous Third Man Argument (Met. VII 13 1038b34-1039a3).
In the Peri Ideˆon (On Ideas), preserved in Ps. Alexander, it is set out as follows: 
{third man/aporia} 
[#####] At the heart of this argument lie three crucial principles: One-over-many: Whenever a plurality of things are F, they are F in virtue of having one thing, the F, predicated of them. (84.22) Separation: Whenever F is predicated of a plurality of things, F is separate from the things of which it is predicated. (84.23a) Self-predication: Any form of F is itself F. (84.28) From Separation, a fourth is derived: Non-identity: Whenever F is predicated of a plurality of things, F is non-identical to the things of which it is predicated. (84.23b)

CONCERNS whether the first principles are particulars or universals 

If universal: they will not be substances

[#####] {bekker@1003.1} {text@Metaphysics} "For if they are universals, they will not be substances, since nothing common signifies a this but rather a such, but substance is a this. And if we can actually posit what is predicated in common [i.e., a universal] as a [particular] this, Socrates will be several animals-himself and man and animal, since each of these signifies some this and one. If, then, the first principles are universals, these things follow.
But if they are not universals, but of the nature of particulars, they will not be knowable. For the scientific knowledge of all things is universal. It follows that there must be other principles prior to the first principles, which are predicated universally of them, if indeed there is to be knowledge of them. [And this is absurd, since no principles are prior to first ones]" [#/#]

<@332.24@ {primacy problem} IS THE MOST fundamental problem with {Platonism}, as opossed to {one-over-many) and {third-man}, and this is because it is also a problem for {Aristotle} 
[#####] This two-part problem-the first part about definition, the second about ontology and scientific knowledge-is the Primacy Dilemma. It is the focus of the chapters that follow. For, unlike either One-over-many or the Third Man, it is as much a problem for Aristotle himself as for his Plato.
For to be ontologically primary, Aristotle’s own substances have to be particulars. But to be substances they must also be epistemologically primary.
Therein lies the rub. For, like Socrates and Plato, Aristotle believes that it is universals, specifically universal essences, not particulars, that are primary in this way. But, apparently, nothing can be both a universal and a particular-look at the disasters that befall Platonism.


The Primacy Dilemma is a serious problem, therefore, and one whose seriousness Aristotle clearly recognizes. In fact, he describes it as the "greatest" of the problems philosophy faces (Met. XIII 10 1087a10-13).

Others that are common to all sciences, such as the principle of non-contradiction, have a somewhat different character (9.4).
Since all these first principles are necessary, and demonstration is necessity preserving, scientific theorems are also necessary.

<@332.25.3@ {induction} {epagōgē} {EXPLANATION} 
Induction begins with perception of particulars, which in turn gives rise to retention of perceptual contents, or memory. When many perceptual contents have been retained in memory, we "come to have an account out of the retention of such things" (APo. II 19 100a1-3).

Craft and science {technē} {epistēm/emacron} arise from {experience} {empeiria} (??) which is a unified set of such memories (100a3-6), "when, from many notions gained by experience, one universal supposition about similar objects is produced" (Met. I 1 981a1-7). Getting from particulars to universals, therefore, is a largely noninferential and epistemologically unproblematic process. If we simply attend to particular cases- perhaps to all, perhaps to just one-and have some acumen (agchinoia), we will get there.4

Merely apparent endoxa, by contrast, are opinions that mistakenly appear to have this uncontested status (I 1 100b23-25, 10 104a15-33).

{aporia} 
Defending first principles on the basis of endoxa is a matter of going through the problems (aporiai) "on both sides of a subject" until they are solved (Top. I 2 101a35). Suppose, for example, that the topic for dialectical investigation is this: Is being one and unchanging, or not? A competent dialectician will, first, follow out the consequences of each disjunct to see what problems they face. Second, he will go through the problems he has uncovered to determine which can be solved and which cannot (VIII 14 163b9-12). As a result he will be well placed to attack or defend either disjunct in the strongest possible way.

{peirastic} 
But in that claim lies a problem. For while dialectic treats things "only in relation to opinion," philosophy must treat them "according to their truth" (Top. I 14 105b30-31). Endoxa, however, are just opinions accepted without demurral by "everyone, or by the majority, or by the wise." Since even such unopposed beliefs may nevertheless be false, how can an argument that relies on them be guaranteed to reach the truth? The answer lies in peirastic (peirastikˆe)-in aporematic philosophy’s dialectical capacity to examine (I 1 101b3).

Peirastic is "a type of dialectic which has in view not the person who knows but the one who pretends to know, but does not" 
{sophistic refutation} {DISTINCTION} from {peirastic} 
For whereas peirastic exposes the genuine ignorance of someone 
who pretends to scientific knowledge, sophistical refutations give the appearance of exposing the ignorance of someone who really does have such knowledge (I 6 168b4-10).


[SKIPPING FORWARD] 
In many texts, Aristotle characterizes problems as knots in our understanding that dialectic enables us to untie, in others, he characterizes dialectic itself as enabling us to make first principles clear.11 What aporematic philosophy offers us in regard to the first principles of the sciences, then, is no knots-no impediments to clear and exact understanding.
And with such clarity comes understanding of the most excellent and unqualified sort that manifests the virtue of theoretical wisdom. For such understanding could not be "the most exact form of scientific knowledge" if aporematic philosophy could make yet clearer and more exact what it had already grasped (EN VI 7 1141a16-17). Aporematic philosophy, then, is what the second stage of induction-the stage that culminates in under- 
standing’s grasp of analyzed universals-consists in. It is patently a descendent of the Socratic elenchus.12 Aporematic is not, however, the whole of philosophy. There are philosophical sciences similar in structure to the other more familiar ones (9.2- 3). It is the philosopher-as-scientist’s job to discover the first principles of these and, as aporematic philosopher, to defend them against arguments based on endoxa.

It might be held that all men seek to obtain pleasure, because all men desire life. {z/omacrongr} Life is a form of activity {energeia}, and each man exercises his activity upon those objects and with those faculties which he likes the most: for example, the musician exercises his sense of hearing upon musical tones, the student his intellect upon problems of philosophy, and so on. 
And the pleasure of these activities perfects the activities, and therefore perfects life, which all men seek. 
Men have good reason therefore to pursue pleasure, since it perfects for each his life, which is a desirable thing. 
The question whether we desire life for the sake of pleasure or pleasure for the sake of life need not be raised at the present.

In any case they appear to be perfectly united; for there is no pleasure without activity, and also no perfect activity without its pleasure

// 
COULD we also perhaps say that the "higher purpose" that every animal pursues is pleasure itself...AND that everything, to the extent that it is an activity, has a kind of pleasure following upon it...

THIS opens up to the deeper pantheistic dimension of Aristotle's thought...

[My translation]This is also evident from the affinity (belonging-together-with) of each of the pleasures to the activity that it perfects 
συναύξει γὰρ τὴν ἐνέργειαν ἡ (30) οἰκεία ἡδονή. 
The fitting (oikeios} pleasure augments the activity.

μᾶλλον γὰρ ἕκαστα κρίνουσι καὶ ἐξακριβοῦσιν οἰκεία ἡδονή. μᾶλλον γὰρ ἕκαστα κρίνουσι καὶ ἐξακριβοῦσιν οἱ μεθ’ ἡδονῆς ἐνεργοῦντες, οἷον γεωμετρικοὶ γίνονται οἱ χαί- ροντες τῷ γεωμετρεῖν, καὶ κατανοοῦσιν ἕκαστα μᾶλλον, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ οἱ φιλόμουσοι καὶ φιλοικοδόμοι καὶ τῶν ἄλ- λων ἕκαστοι ἐπιδιδόασιν εἰς τὸ οἰκεῖον ἔργον χαίροντες αὐτῷ· (35) συναύξουσι δὲ αἱ ἡδοναί, τὰ δὲ συναύξοντα οἰκεῖα· 
since those who work with pleasure always work with more discernment and with greater accuracy---for instance, students who are fond of geometry become proficient in it, and grasp its various problems better, and similarly lovers of music, architecture or the other arts make progress in their favorite pursuit because they enjoy it. An activity then is augmented by its pleasure; and that which augments a thing must be akin to it. But things that are akin to things of different kinds must themselves differ in kind.

Pleasure is more intimately connected with activity than with the appetite that prompts it...

οἰκειότεραι δὲ ταῖς ἐνεργείαις αἱ ἐν αὐταῖς ἡδοναὶ τῶν ὀρέ- (30) ξεων· 
Thus the pleasure of a good activity is morally good, that of a bad one morally bad; for even desires for noble things are praised and desires for base things are blamed; but the pleasures contianed in our activities are more intimately connected with them than the appetites which prompt them, for the appetite is both separate in time and distinct in its nature from the activity, whereas the pleasure is closely linked to the activity, indeed so insperable from it as to raise a doubt whether the activity is not the same thing as the pleasure. 
αἳ μὲν γὰρ διωρισμέναι εἰσὶ καὶ τοῖς χρόνοις καὶ τῇ φύσει, αἳ δὲ σύνεγγυς ταῖς ἐνεργείαις, καὶ ἀδιόριστοι οὕτως ὥστ’ ἔχειν ἀμφισβήτησιν εἰ ταὐτόν ἐστιν ἡ ἐνέργεια τῇ ἡδονῇ.

For amusement is a form of rest; but we need rest because we are not able to go on working without a break, and therefore it is not an end, since we take it as a means to further activity.

{intellect} {nous} is the most {continuous} {pleasure} 

_ἔτι δὲ συνεχεστάτη·

For we are able to contemplate more continuouslly than any other activity. 
We thing it necessary for pleasure to be mixed into happiness, but the most pleasurable of the activities in accordance with virtue, is that which is in accordance with wisdom {sophia} 
δοκεῖ γοῦν ἡ φιλοσοφία θαυμαστὰς ἡδονὰς ἔχειν (25) καθαρειότητι καὶ τῷ βεβαίῳ, εὔλογον δὲ τοῖς εἰδόσι τῶν ζη- τούντων ἡδίω τὴν διαγωγὴν εἶναι. ἥ τε λεγομένη αὐτάρκεια περὶ τὴν θεωρητικὴν μάλιστ’ ἂν εἴη· τῶν μὲν γὰρ πρὸς τὸ ζῆν ἀναγκαίων καὶ σοφὸς καὶ δίκαιος καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ δέονται, οῖς δὲ τοιούτοις ἱκανῶς κεχορηγημένων ὁ μὲν δίκαιος δεῖται (30) πρὸς οὓς δικαιοπραγήσει καὶ μεθ’ ὧν, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ὁ σώ- φρων καὶ ὁ ἀνδρεῖος καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἕκαστος, ὁ δὲ σοφὸς καὶ καθ’ αὑτὸν ὢν δύναται θεωρεῖν, καὶ ὅσῳ ἂν σοφώτερος ᾖ, μᾶλλον· 
at all events it is held that philosophy or the pursuit of wisdom contains pleasures of marvellous purity and permanence, and it is reasonable to suppose that the enjoyment of knowledge is a still pleasanter occuptation than the pursuit of it. 
Also the activity of contemplation will be found to possess in the highest degree the quality that is termed {self-sufficiency} {autarkeia/gr} 
THIS IS because the wise man has less need of others in order to contemplate 
δόξαι τ’ ἂν αὐτὴ μόνη δι’ αὑτὴν ἀγαπᾶ- σθαι· οὐδὲν γὰρ ἀπ’ αὐτῆς γίνεται παρὰ τὸ θεωρῆσαι, ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν πρακτικῶν ἢ πλεῖον ἢ ἔλαττον περιποιούμεθα παρὰ τὴν πρᾶξιν.

Also the activity of contemplation may be held to be the only activity that is loved for its own sake; it produces no result beyond the actual act of contemplation

But the activity of the politician is also unleisured, and aims at securing something beyond the mere participation in politics---positins of authority and honor, or, if the happiness of the politician himslef and of his fellow-citizenbs, this happiness conceived as something distinct from political activity.

it follows that it is the activity of the intellect that constitutes complete happiness -- provided it be granted a complete span of life, for nothing that belongs to happiness can be incomplete

Moreover, prudence is intimately connected with mroal virtue, and this with prudence, inasmuch as the first principles which prudence employs are determined by the moral virtues, and the right standard for the moral virtues is determined by prudence. But these being also connected with the passions are related to our composite nature; not the virtues of our composite nature are purely human; so therefore also is the life that manifests these virtues, and the happiness that belongs to it.

<@335.44.1@ {REFLECTION} 
It now seems that {happiness} is necessarily connected with {contemplation} {RELATION}...Is this consistent with what was said before?? 
Is this introducing a new {DEFINITION} of {eudaimonia}? 
BUT perhaps we could think of it as actually establishing the continuity between everydayness and the life of the philosopher. 
There is, as it were, a perspectival shift that takes place, but the second perspective (of the theoretical life) develops out of the first...

THE wise man is dearest to the gods. 
And it seems like that the man who pursues intellectual activity and who cultivates his intellect and keeps that in the best condition, is also the man most beloved of the gods. For if, as is generally believed, the gods exercise some superintendence {epimeleia/gr} over human affairs, then it will be reasonable to suppose that they take pleasure in that part of man which is best and most akin to themselves, namely the intellect {nous}, and that they recompense with their favours those men who esteem and honour this the moast, because these care for the things dear to themselves, and act rightly and nobly.

Now it is clear that all these attributes belong most of all to the wise man {sophos/gr}. He is therefore the most beloved by the gods {theophilestatos/gr}, and if so, he is naturally most happy.

When the existence or occurance of b follows from that of a, people suppose that, if by is the case, a too must exist or be occurent; but this is false. So, if the antecedent is false, but were it true some further fact would necessarily exist or occur, the poet should supply the latter: because it knows the truth of the consequent, our mind falsely infers the truth of the antecedent to.

<@346.2@ Aristotle approaches the {DEFINITION} of {soul} by way of a division of {substances} {ousia} 
1) Substance is one class of beings {on/gr} 
2) There are three kinds of substances: 
[###](a)matter
(b)form
(c)both conbined 
[#/#] 
Matter is {potentiality} {dunamis} whereas form is {entelecheia} {actuality} 
But there are two senses {DISTINCTION} of {actuality}, as exemplified by the distinction between {scientific knowledge} {epistēmē} and the exercise =contemplation {theōrein/gr}.

3) Bodies {sōmata} seem to be preminently substances, and especially the {physikos} {physical body} 

For these are the sources (arch/emacro/} from which the rest are derived.

4) Of natural bodies, some have life, some do not. {z/omacrongr} 

By life we mean the capacity for {nourishment} {trophē} {growth} and {decay} {phthisis}.

5) Every natural body which possesses life must be substance, and substance of the compound type.

6) But since it is a body of a definite kind, viz. having life, the body cannot be soul, for the body is not something predicated of a subject {hupokeimenon}, but rahter is itself to be regarded as a {subject}, i.e. as matter.

7) {DEFINITION} of {soul} So the soul must be substance in the sense ofn being the form of a natural body which potentially has life.

And substance in this sense is actuality. 
The soul then is the actaulity of the kind of body we have described.

<@346.9@ The soiul cannot be separated from the body {chōristē/gr} 
It is quite clear, then, that neither the soul nor certain parts of it, if it has parts, can be separated from the body; for in some cases the actuality belongs to the parts themselves.

But it is also uncertain whether the soul as an actuality bears the same relation to the body as the sailor to the ship. 
This must suffice as an attempt to determine in rough outline the nature of the soul.

That the soul is the cause in the sense of substance is obvious; for substance is the cause of existence in all things, and for living creatures existence is life, and of these the soul is the cause and first principle.

<@346.29@ The {soul} as {telos} {final cause} 
Clearly the soul is also the cause in the final sense. For just as mind acts with some purpose in view, so too does nature, and this purpose is its end.

In living creatures, the soul supplies such a purpose, and this is in accordance with nature, for all natural bodies are instruments of the soul; and just as is the case with the bodies of animals, so with those of plants.

This shows that they exist for the sake of the soul

<@346.44@ {chapter@6} {book@2} 
In discussing the several senses, we must speak of their respective objects.

Λεκτέον δὲ καθ’ ἑκάστην αἴσθησιν περὶ τῶν αἰσθητῶν πρῶτον 
The term object of sense {aisthiton/gr} is used of three types 
λέγεται δὲ τὸ αἰσθητὸν τριχῶς 
two of them we say that we perceive directly, and one indirectly. 
ὧν δύο μὲν καθ’ αὑτά φαμεν αἰσθάνεσθαι, τὸ δὲ ἓν κατὰ συμβεβηκός 
[BAD translation: with respect to itself, vs. {incidentally}] 
Of the first two, one is an object proper to a given sense, and the other is an object perceptible by all the senses. By proper object I mean that which cannot be perceived by any other sense, and concerning which error is impossible. i.e sight is concerned with color, hearing with sound, and taste with flavour.

Touch of course has many varieties of object.

Each sense has its proper sphere, nor it is deceived as to the fact of color or sound, but only as to the nature and position of the coloured object or the thing which makes the sound. Such objects we call proper to a particular sense, but perception of movement, rest, number, shape and size is shared by several senses.

For things of this kind are not proper to any one sense, but common to all; for instance some kinds of movement are perceptible both by touch and by sight.
I call an object indirectly [incidentally] perceived if, for example, the white thing seen is the son of Diares; this is an indirect perception, because that which is perceived (the son of Diares) only belongs incidentally to whiteness. Hence the percipient is not acted upon by the thing perceived as such. But of per se perceptibles those are most strictly perceptible that are proper to a given sense, and it is to these that the special nature of the several senbses is adapted.

Λεκτέον δὲ καθ’ ἑκάστην αἴσθησιν περὶ τῶν αἰσθητῶν πρῶτον. λέγεται δὲ τὸ αἰσθητὸν τριχῶς, ὧν δύο μὲν καθ’ αὑτά φαμεν αἰσθάνεσθαι, τὸ δὲ ἓν κατὰ συμβεβηκός. τῶν δὲ δυοῖν τὸ μὲν ἴδιόν ἐστιν ἑκάστης αἰσθήσεως, τὸ δὲ κοινὸν (10) πασῶν. λέγω δ’ ἴδιον μὲν ὃ μὴ ἐνδέχεται ἑτέρᾳ αἰσθήσει αἰσθάνεσθαι, καὶ περὶ ὃ μὴ ἐνδέχεται ἀπατηθῆναι, οἷον ὄψις χρώματος καὶ ἀκοὴ ψόφου καὶ γεῦσις χυμοῦ, ἡ δ’ ἁφὴ πλείους [μὲν] ἔχει διαφοράς, ἀλλ’ ἑκάστη γε κρίνει περὶ τούτων, καὶ οὐκ ἀπατᾶται ὅτι χρῶμα οὐδ’ ὅτι ψόφος, (15) ἀλλὰ τί τὸ κεχρωσμένον ἢ ποῦ, ἢ τί τὸ ψοφοῦν ἢ ποῦ. τὰ μὲν οὖν τοιαῦτα λέγεται ἴδια ἑκάστης, κοινὰ δὲ κίνησις, ἠρε- μία, ἀριθμός, σχῆμα, μέγεθος· τὰ γὰρ τοιαῦτα οὐδεμιᾶς ἐστὶν ἴδια, ἀλλὰ κοινὰ πάσαις· καὶ γὰρ ἁφῇ κίνησίς τίς ἐστιν αἰσθητὴ καὶ ὄψει. κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς δὲ λέγεται αἰ- (20) σθητόν, οἷον εἰ τὸ λευκὸν εἴη Διάρους υἱός· κατὰ συμ- βεβηκὸς γὰρ τούτου αἰσθάνεται, ὅτι τῷ λευκῷ συμβέβηκε τοῦτο, οὗ αἰσθάνεται· διὸ καὶ οὐδὲν πάσχει ᾗ τοιοῦτον ὑπὸ τοῦ αἰσθητοῦ. τῶν δὲ καθ’ αὑτὰ αἰσθητῶν τὰ ἴδια κυρίως ἐστὶν αἰσθητά, καὶ πρὸς ἃ ἡ οὐσία πέφυκεν ἑκάστης αἰσθήσεως.

<@346.61@ {chapter@12} {book@2} 
We must understand as true generally of every sense: 
1) that sense is that which is receptive of the form of sensible objects without the matter, just as the wax receives the impression of the signet-ring without the iron or the gold, and received the impression of the gold or bronze, but not as gold or bronze; so in every case sense is affected by that which has color or flavor or sound, but bu it, not qua having a particular identity, but qua having a certain quality, and in virtue of its formula 
αθόλου δὲ περὶ πάσης αἰσθήσεως δεῖ λαβεῖν ὅτι ἡ μὲν αἴσθησίς ἐστι τὸ δεκτικὸν τῶν αἰσθητῶν εἰδῶν ἄνευ τῆς ὕλης, οἷον ὁ κηρὸς τοῦ δακτυλίου ἄνευ τοῦ σιδήρου καὶ τοῦ χρυσοῦ δέχεται τὸ σημεῖον, λαμβάνει δὲ τὸ χρυσοῦν ἢ τὸ (20) χαλκοῦν σημεῖον, ἀλλ’ οὐχ ᾗ χρυσὸς ἢ χαλκός· ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἡ αἴσθησις ἑκάστου ὑπὸ τοῦ ἔχοντος χρῶμα ἢ χυμὸν ἢ ψόφον πάσχει, ἀλλ’ οὐχ ᾗ ἕκαστον ἐκείνων λέγεται, ἀλλ’ ᾗ τοιονδί, καὶ κατὰ τὸν λόγον. 
2) The sense organ in its primary meaning is that in which this potentiality lies. The organ and the potentiality are identified, but their essential nature is not the same.
The sentient subject must be extended, but sensivity and sense cannot be extended; they are a kind of ratio and potentiality of the said subject.

αἰσθητήριον δὲ πρῶτον ἐν ᾧ ἡ τοιαύτη δύναμις. ἔστι μὲν οὖν ταὐτόν, τὸ δ’ εἶναι ἕτερον· @1 (25) μέγεθος μὲν γὰρ ἄν τι εἴη τὸ αἰσθανόμενον, οὐ μὴν τό γε αἰσθητικῷ εἶναι οὐδ’ ἡ αἴσθησις μέγεθός ἐστιν, ἀλλὰ λό- γος τις καὶ δύναμις ἐκείνου.

Hence the excess in the perceptibility of the object destroys the sense organ.



For neither light and darkness, nor sound, nor smell affects bodies at all: it is the obejcts in whcih they reside that produce the effect, just as it is the air with the thunderbold that splits the timber.

οὔτε γὰρ φῶς καὶ σκότος οὔτε ψόφος οὔτε ὀσμὴ οὐδὲν ποιεῖ (10) τὰ σώματα, ἀλλ’ ἐν οἷς ἐστίν, οἷον ἀὴρ ὁ μετὰ βροντῆς διίστησι τὸ ξύλον. ἀλλὰ τὰ ἁπτὰ καὶ οἱ χυμοὶ ποιοῦσιν· εἰ γὰρ μή, ὑπὸ τίνος ἂν πάσχοι τὰ ἄψυχα καὶ ἀλλοιοῖτο; ἆρ’ οὖν κἀκεῖνα ποιήσει; ἢ οὐ πᾶν σῶμα παθητικὸν ὑπ’ ὀσμῆς καὶ ψόφου, καὶ τὰ πάσχοντα ἀόριστα, καὶ οὐ μένει, οἷον (15) ἀήρ (ὄζει γὰρ ὥσπερ παθών τι); τί οὖν ἐστι τὸ ὀσμᾶσθαι @1 παρὰ τὸ πάσχειν τι; ἢ τὸ μὲν ὀσμᾶσθαι αἰσθάνεσθαι, ὁ δ’ ἀὴρ παθὼν ταχέως αἰσθητὸς γίνεται;

since each sense perceives one kind of object, there cannot be a special sense for the commmon sensibles.

_ταῦτα γὰρ πάντα [κινήσει] αἰσθανόμεθα, οἷον μέγεθος κινήσει (ὥστε καὶ σχῆμα· μέγεθος γάρ τι τὸ σχῆμα), τὸ δ’ ἠρεμοῦν τῷ μὴ κι- νεῖσθαι, ὁ δ’ ἀριθμὸς τῇ ἀποφάσει τοῦ συνεχοῦς, καὶ τοῖς ἰδίοις (ἑκάστη γὰρ ἓν αἰσθάνεται αἴσθησις)· ὥστε δῆλον ὅτι ἀδύνατον (20) ὁτουοῦν ἰδίαν αἴσθησιν εἶναι τούτων, οἷον κινήσεως· οὕτω γὰρ ἔσται ὥσπερ νῦν τῇ ὄψει τὸ γλυκὺ αἰσθανόμεθα· τοῦτο δ’ ὅτι ἀμφοῖν ἔχοντες τυγχάνομεν αἴσθησιν, ᾗ ὅταν συμ- πέσωσιν ἅμα γνωρίζομεν. εἰ δὲ μή, οὐδαμῶς ἂν ἀλλ’ ἢ κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς ᾐσθανόμεθα (οἷον τὸν Κλέωνος υἱὸν οὐχ ὅτι (25) Κλέωνος υἱός, ἀλλ’ ὅτι λευκός, τούτῳ δὲ συμβέβηκεν υἱῷ Κλέωνος εἶναι)· τῶν δὲ κοινῶν ἤδη ἔχομεν αἴσθησιν κοινήν, οὐ κατὰ συμβεβηκός 
But we have already a common faculty which apprehends common sensibles directly.

Therefore there is no special sense for them.

τῶν δὲ κοινῶν ἤδη ἔχομεν αἴσθησιν κοινήν, οὐ κατὰ συμβεβηκός· οὐκ ἄρ’ ἐστὶν ἰδία· 
The senses perceive each other's proper objects incidentally, not in their own identity, but acting together as one, when sensation occurs simultaneously in the case of the same object, as for instance of bile, that it is bitter and yellow; for it is not the part of any single sense to state that both objects are one.

It may be in order that the accompanying common sensibles, such as movement size and number may escape us less; for if visioin were our only sense, and it perceived mere whiteness, they would be less apparent; indeed all sensibles would be indistinguishable, because of the concomitance of, e.g. colour and size. As it is, the fact that common sensibles inhere in the obejcts of more than one sense shows that each of them is something distinct.

<@347.6@ Regarding the {QUESTION} {PROBLEM} of how we can see sight itself.

{book@3} {chapter@2} 
This is either (1) by sight itself, or (2) by another sense. If (2) then, [since colour is the object of sight, and seeing sight implies seeing the object of sight (?)], then two senses [i.e. vision, and metavision] would see the same object. ALSO: if (2) then there is an {infinite regress}, or you will reach some sense that senses itself.

Hence we must conclude that the primary sense is self-sensing...[since the (2) just leads to a pointless mediation] 

But then a difficulty arises. 
"for if perception by vision is seeing, and that which is seen either is colour or has colour,m then if one is to see that which sees, it follows that what primarily sees will possess colour." 
THE {SOLUTION} to this {aporia/gr}: 
{en to tē aisthanesthai/syntagm} has more than one meaning..."for even when we do not see, we discern darkness and light by vision, but not in the same way [as we discern colors]" [i.e. we see not only color, but the absence of color, and the actualization or non actualization of the medium] 

ALSO: {solution@2} That which sees does possess color, but only formally, not materially. "THis is why, even when the objects of perception are gone, sensations {aisthēsis} and mental images {phantasia} are still in the sense organs." 
Ἐπεὶ δ’ αἰσθανόμεθα ὅτι ὁρῶμεν καὶ ἀκούομεν, ἀνάγκη ἢ τῇ ὄψει αἰσθάνεσθαι ὅτι ὁρᾷ, ἢ ἑτέρᾳ. ἀλλ’ ἡ αὐτὴ ἔσται τῆς ὄψεως καὶ τοῦ ὑποκειμένου χρώματος, ὥστε ἢ δύο τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἔσονται ἢ αὐτὴ αὑτῆς. ἔτι δ’ εἰ καὶ ἑτέρα εἴη ἡ τῆς (15) ὄψεως αἴσθησις, ἢ εἰς ἄπειρον εἶσιν ἢ αὐτή τις ἔσται αὑτῆς· ὥστ’ ἐπὶ τῆς πρώτης τοῦτο ποιητέον. ἔχει δ’ ἀπορίαν· εἰ γὰρ τὸ τῇ ὄψει αἰσθάνεσθαί ἐστιν ὁρᾶν, ὁρᾶται δὲ χρῶμα ἢ τὸ ἔχον, εἰ ὄψεταί τις τὸ ὁρῶν, καὶ χρῶμα ἕξει τὸ ὁρῶν πρῶ- τον. φανερὸν τοίνυν ὅτι οὐχ ἓν τὸ τῇ ὄψει αἰσθάνεσθαι· καὶ τον. φανερὸν τοίνυν ὅτι οὐχ ἓν τὸ τῇ ὄψει αἰσθάνεσθαι· καὶ (20) γὰρ ὅταν μὴ ὁρῶμεν, τῇ ὄψει κρίνομεν καὶ τὸ σκότος καὶ τὸ φῶς, ἀλλ’ οὐχ ὡσαύτως. ἔτι δὲ καὶ τὸ ὁρῶν ἔστιν ὡς κεχρωμάτισται· τὸ γὰρ αἰσθητήριον δεκτικὸν τοῦ αἰσθητοῦ ἄνευ τῆς ὕλης ἕκαστον· διὸ καὶ ἀπελθόντων τῶν αἰσθητῶν ἔνεισιν αἰσθήσεις καὶ φαντασίαι ἐν τοῖς αἰσθητηρίοις.

<@347.9@ But since the activity of the sensible and of the sensitive is the same, though their essence is different, it follows that hearing in the active sense must cease or continue simultaneously with the sound and so with flavor and taste and the rest; but this does not apply to their potentialities

Hence the earlier natural philosophers were wrong to think that black and white have no existence without vision, nor flavor without taste 
sensation and sensible being are used in two senses: potentially and actually. {kata dunamin/syntagm} {kata energeian/syntagm}

{legein} {noein} {aisthanomai} {RELATION} 
Nor can it judge this at separate times, since the "time when" is not incidental to the judgment. [the "nowness" is implicit, and hence appears redundant if stated explicitly...] 
Yet it is impossible for the same faculty should be moved at the same time with contrary movements 
"Are we then to suppose that the judging faculty is numerically indivisible and inseparable, but is divided in essence?" 
"The in one sense it is what is divided that perceives divided things, but in a sense it does this qua indivisible" 

_ἔστι δὴ [πως] ὡς τὸ διαιρε- τὸν τῶν διῃρημένων αἰσθάνεται, ἔστι δ’ ὡς ᾗ ἀδιαίρετον· τῷ εἶναι μὲν γὰρ διαιρετόν, τόπῳ δὲ καὶ ἀριθμῷ ἀδιαίρετον.

For it is divisible in essence, but indivisible spatially and numerically. Or is this impossible? 
For although the same indivisible thing may be both contraries potentially, it is not so in essence, but it becomes divisible in actualization 
THE conclusion here seems very strange, aporetic...

<@347.14@ {thinking} {noein} {EXPLANATION} 
Thinking, both speculative and practical, is regarded as a form of perceiving; for in both cases the soul judges and has cognizance of something which is.

Ἐπεὶ δὲ δύο διαφοραῖς ὁρίζονται μάλιστα τὴν ψυχήν, κινήσει τε τῇ κατὰ τόπον καὶ τῷ νοεῖν καὶ φρονεῖν καὶ αἰσθάνεσθαι, δοκεῖ δὲ καὶ τὸ νοεῖν καὶ τὸ φρονεῖν ὥσπερ αἰσθάνεσθαί τι εἶναι (ἐν ἀμφοτέροις γὰρ τούτοις κρίνει τι ἡ (20) ψυχὴ καὶ γνωρίζει τῶν ὄντων), καὶ οἵ γε ἀρχαῖοι τὸ φρο- νεῖν καὶ τὸ αἰσθάνεσθαι ταὐτὸν εἶναί φασιν 
{gnōrizein/gr} 
The older philosophers regarded thinking and perceiving as identical . {Empedocles} {Homer} 
For all these auhtors suppose the process of thinking to be a bodily function like perceiving, and that men both perceive and recongize like by like, as we have explained at the beginning of the treatise.

And yet they ought to have made some metion of error at the same time; for error seems to be more natural to living creatures, and the soul spend more time in it.

ὥσπερ καὶ Ἐμπεδοκλῆς εἴρηκε "πρὸς παρεὸν γὰρ μῆτις ἀέξεται ἀνθρώ- ποισιν" καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις "ὅθεν σφίσιν αἰεὶ καὶ τὸ φρονεῖν ἀλλοῖα παρίσταται", τὸ δ’ αὐτὸ τούτοις βούλεται καὶ τὸ Ὁμή- (25) ρου "τοῖος γὰρ νόος ἐστίν", πάντες γὰρ οὗτοι τὸ νοεῖν σωματικὸν ὥσπερ τὸ αἰσθάνεσθαι ὑπολαμβάνουσιν, καὶ αἰσθάσωματικὸν ὥσπερ τὸ αἰσθάνεσθαι ὑπολαμβάνουσιν, καὶ αἰσθά- νεσθαί τε καὶ φρονεῖν τῷ ὁμοίῳ τὸ ὅμοιον, ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν τοῖς κατ’ ἀρχὰς λόγοις διωρίσαμεν (καίτοι ἔδει ἅμα καὶ περὶ (427b) τοῦ ἠπατῆσθαι αὐτοὺς λέγειν, οἰκειότερον γὰρ τοῖς ζῴοις, καὶ πλείω χρόνον ἐν τούτῳ διατελεῖ ἡ ψυχή· διὸ ἀνάγκη ἤτοι, ὥσπερ ἔνιοι λέγουσι, πάντα τὰ φαινόμενα εἶναι ἀληθῆ, @1 ἢ τὴν τοῦ ἀνομοίου θίξιν ἀπάτην εἶναι, τοῦτο γὰρ ἐναντίον τῷ τὸ ὅμοιον τῷ ὁμοίῳ γνωρίζειν· δοκεῖ δὲ καὶ ἡ ἀπάτη καὶ (5) ἡ ἐπιστήμη τῶν ἐναντίων ἡ αὐτὴ εἶναι) 
From this belief it must follow either that, as some say, all appearances {phainomena} are {true} {alēth/emacron}, or that error is contact with the unlike; for this is the opposite of recongizing like by like.

But it seems like the error and the knowledge {epistēm/emacron} of the contraries {enantios/gr} is the same. [Loeb: It appears that in the case of contraries error, like knowledge, is one and the same]

<@347.15@ Not it is quite clear that perceiving and practical thinking are not the same {aisthanesthai/gr} {phronein}; for all living creatures have a share in the former, but only a few in the latter. Nor again is speculative thinking, which involves being right or wrong. {orthōs} Being right correspondending to intellectigence and knowledge and true opinion {phronēsis} and {epistēmē} and true opinion {doxa alēthē/syntagm} and being wrong to their contraries--the same thing as perceiving; for the perception of proper objects [i.e. primary objects] is always true, and is a characteristic of all living creatures, but it is possible to think falsely, and thought belongs to animal which has not reasoning power.

; for imagination is different from both perception and thought; imagination always implies perception, and is itself implied by judgment. But clearly imagination and judgment are differnet modes of thought. For the former is an affection lies in our power whenever we choose (for it is possible to call up mental pictures, as those who employ images in arranging their ideas under a mnemonic system), but it is not in our power to form opinions as we will; for we must either hold a false opinion or a true one. 
Again, when we form an opinion that something is threatening or frightening, wew are immediately affected by it, and the same is true of our opinon of something that inspires courage; but in imagination we are like speactators looking at something dreadful or encouraging in a picture. Judgment itself, too, has various forms --- knowledge, opinion, prudence, and their opposite {hupolepsis/gr}[=judgment] but their differences must be the subject of another discussion.

<@347.18@ {imagination} {phantasia} is not a {sensation} {aisthēsis} 
sensation is either potential or actual, either sight or seeing, but imagination occurs when neither of these is present, as when objects are seen in dreams.

_ὅτι μὲν οὖν οὐκ ἔστιν αἴσθησις, δῆλον ἐκ (5) τῶνδε. αἴσθησις μὲν γὰρ ἤτοι δύναμις ἢ ἐνέργεια, οἷον ὄψις καὶ ὅρασις, φαίνεται δέ τι καὶ μηδετέρου ὑπάρχοντος τού- των, οἷον τὰ ἐν τοῖς ὕπνοις. εἶτα αἴσθησις μὲν ἀεὶ πάρεστι, φαντασία δ’ οὔ. 
{hupnos/gr} 
(2) sensation is always present but imagination is not. 

_εἶτα αἴσθησις μὲν ἀεὶ πάρεστι, φαντασία δ’ οὔ.

(3) if sensation and imagination were identical in actuality, then imagination would be possible for all creatures; but it is not true for the ant, bee, grub.

(4) all sensations are true [??], but most imaginations are false.

(5) We say "i imaginate that it is a man" when our sense it not functioning accurately with regard to the object.

(6) visions seen by men even with their eyes shut 
(7) Not is imagination any of the faculties which are always right, such as knowedge or intelligence.

<@347.19@ IS {imagination} then {opinion} ?? 
For opinion is either true {alēthēs} or false {pseudēs} 
But opinion implies belief {pistis}...for one cannot hold opinions that one does not believe...and no animal has belief, but many have imagination.

λείπεται ἄρα ἰδεῖν εἰ δόξα· γίνεται γὰρ δόξα καὶ ἀληθὴς καὶ ψευδής, ἀλλὰ δόξῃ μὲν ἕπεται πίστις (οὐκ ἐνδέχεται γὰρ δοξάζοντα οἷς (20) δοκεῖ μὴ πιστεύειν), τῶν δὲ θηρίων οὐθενὶ ὑπάρχει πίστις, φαντασία δὲ πολλοῖς.

Again, every opinion {doxa} is accompanied by belief {pistis} and {pistis} is accompanied by {conviction} {pepeishai/gr} {peithos} and conviction by rational discourse {logos} 
But although some creatures have imagination, they have no reasoning power.

It is clear then that imagination cannot be either opinion in conjunction with sensation, or opinion based on sensation, or a blend of opinion and sensation, both for the reasons given, and because the opinion relates to nothing else but the object of sensation 
: I mean that imagination is the blend of the perception of white with the opinion that it is white--not surely of the perception of white with the opinon it is good.


To imagine then is to form an opinon exactly corresponding to a direct perception.

_τὸ οὖν φαίνεσθαι ἔσται τὸ δοξάζειν ὅπερ αἰσθάνεται, μὴ κατὰ συμβεβηκός 
But things about which we have at the same time a {true} belief may have a {false} appearance 
for instance the sun appears to measure a foot across, but we are convinced that it is greater than the inhabited globne...

globe 
φαίνεται δέ γε καὶ ψευδῆ, περὶ ὧν ἅμα ὑπόληψιν ἀληθῆ ἔχει, οἷον φαίνεται μὲν ὁ ἥλιος ποδι- αῖος, πιστεύεται δ’ εἶναι μείζων τῆς οἰκουμένης· συμβαίνει οὖν ἤτοι ἀποβεβληκέναι τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἀληθῆ δόξαν, ἣν εἶχε, (5) σωζομένου τοῦ πράγματος, μὴ ἐπιλαθόμενον μηδὲ μεταπει- σθέντα, ἢ εἰ ἔτι ἔχει, ἀνάγκη τὴν αὐτὴν ἀληθῆ εἶναι καὶ ψευδῆ.

it follows, then, that either the percipient, without any alteration in the thing itself, and without forgetting or changing his mind, has rejected the true opinon which he had, or, if he still holds that opinion, it must be at once true and false.

But a true opinion only becomes false when the fact changes unnoticed. Imagination, then, is not one of these things, nor a compound of them..

[SO imagination is NOT a blend of perception and opinion?!]

<@347.20@ {imagination} {EXPLANATION} 
imagination is a movement causes by [the movement of] sensation 
ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ ἔστι κινηθέντος τουδὶ κινεῖσθαι ἕτερον ὑπὸ (10) τούτου, ἡ δὲ φαντασία κίνησίς τις δοκεῖ εἶναι καὶ οὐκ ἄνευ αἰσθήσεως γίνεσθαι ἀλλ’ αἰσθανομένοις καὶ ὧν αἴσθησις ἔστιν, ἔστι δὲ γίνεσθαι κίνησιν ὑπὸ τῆς ἐνεργείας τῆς αἰσθή- σεως, καὶ ταύτην ὁμοίαν ἀνάγκη εἶναι τῇ αἰσθήσει, εἴη ἂν @1 αὕτη ἡ κίνησις οὔτε ἄνευ αἰσθήσεως ἐνδεχομένη οὔτε μὴ αἰσθα- (15) νομένοις ὑπάρχειν, καὶ πολλὰ κατ’ αὐτὴν καὶ ποιεῖν καὶ πάσχειν τὸ ἔχον, καὶ εἶναι καὶ ἀληθῆ καὶ ψευδῆ. 
in virtue of it the possessor may act and be acted upon in various ways, and the movement may be true or false 
This last point is explained as follows: 
(1) preception of proper objects is true, or only capable of accepting the least degree of error (2) perception that they are attributes, introduces more error. (whether a white thing is this or something else) 
(3) perception of common attributes introduces more error (i.e. motion magnitude) 

But the movement produced by the sense-activity will differ from the actual sensation in each of these three modes of perception.

the first is true whenever the sensation is present, but the others may be false both when it is present and when it is absent, and especially when the sensible object is at a distance.

If then imagination involves nothing else than we have stated, and is as we have described it, then imagination must be a movement produced by sensation actively operating. 
Since sight is the chief sense, the name phantasia {imagination} is derived from {phōs} because without light it is not possible to see. 
Agian, because imaginations persist in us and resemble sensations, living creatures frequently act in accordance with them, siome, viz. the brutes because they have no mind, and some, viz, men, because the mind is temporality clouded over by emotion, or disease, or sleep. Let this suffice about the nature and cause of imagination.

_ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ ἔστι κινηθέντος τουδὶ κινεῖσθαι ἕτερον ὑπὸ (10) τούτου, ἡ δὲ φαντασία κίνησίς τις δοκεῖ εἶναι καὶ οὐκ ἄνευ αἰσθήσεως γίνεσθαι ἀλλ’ αἰσθανομένοις καὶ ὧν αἴσθησις ἔστιν, ἔστι δὲ γίνεσθαι κίνησιν ὑπὸ τῆς ἐνεργείας τῆς αἰσθή- σεως, καὶ ταύτην ὁμοίαν ἀνάγκη εἶναι τῇ αἰσθήσει, εἴη ἂν @1 αὕτη ἡ κίνησις οὔτε ἄνευ αἰσθήσεως ἐνδεχομένη οὔτε μὴ αἰσθα- (15) νομένοις ὑπάρχειν, καὶ πολλὰ κατ’ αὐτὴν καὶ ποιεῖν καὶ πάσχειν τὸ ἔχον, καὶ εἶναι καὶ ἀληθῆ καὶ ψευδῆ. τοῦτο δὲ συμβαίνει διὰ τάδε· ἡ αἴσθησις τῶν μὲν ἰδίων ἀληθής ἐστιν ἢ ὅτι ὀλίγιστον ἔχουσα τὸ ψεῦδος. δεύτερον δὲ τοῦ συμβεβηκέναι ταῦτα [ἃ συμβέβηκε τοῖς αἰσθητοῖς]· (20) καὶ ἐνταῦθα ἤδη ἐνδέχεται διαψεύ- (20a) δεσθαι· ὅτι μὲν γὰρ λευκόν, οὐ ψεύδεται, εἰ δὲ τοῦτο τὸ λευ- (21) κὸν ἢ ἄλλο τι, ψεύδεται. τρίτον δὲ τῶν κοινῶν καὶ ἑπομένων τοῖς συμβεβηκόσιν οἷς ὑπάρχει τὰ ἴδια (λέγω δ’ οἷον κί- νησις καὶ μέγεθος) [ἃ συμβέβηκε τοῖς αἰσθητοῖς]· περὶ ἃ μάλιστα ἤδη ἔστιν ἀπατηθῆναι κατὰ τὴν αἴσθησιν. ἡ δὲ κί- (25) νησις ἡ ὑπὸ τῆς ἐνεργείας τῆς αἰσθήσεως γινομένη διοίσει, ἡ ἀπὸ τούτων τῶν τριῶν αἰσθήσεων, καὶ ἡ μὲν πρώτη παρ- ούσης τῆς αἰσθήσεως ἀληθής, αἱ δ’ ἕτεραι καὶ παρούσης καὶ ἀπούσης εἶεν ἂν ψευδεῖς, καὶ μάλιστα ὅταν πόρρω τὸ αἰσθη- τὸν ᾖ. εἰ οὖν μηθὲν ἄλλο ἔχει τὰ εἰρημένα ἢ φαν- (30) (429a) τασία (τοῦτο δ’ ἐστὶ τὸ λεχθέν), ἡ φαντασία ἂν εἴη κίνησις ὑπὸ τῆς αἰσθήσεως τῆς κατ’ ἐνέργειαν γιγνομένη. ἐπεὶ δ’ ἡ ὄψις μάλιστα αἴσθησίς ἐστι, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα ἀπὸ τοῦ φάους εἴ- ληφεν, ὅτι ἄνευ φωτὸς οὐκ ἔστιν ἰδεῖν. καὶ διὰ τὸ ἐμμένειν καὶ ὁμοίας εἶναι ταῖς αἰσθήσεσι, πολλὰ κατ’ αὐτὰς πράτ- (5) τει τὰ ζῷα, τὰ μὲν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν νοῦν, οἷον τὰ θηρία, @1 τὰ δὲ διὰ τὸ ἐπικαλύπτεσθαι τὸν νοῦν ἐνίοτε πάθει ἢ νόσῳ ἢ ὕπνῳ, οἷον οἱ ἄνθρωποι. περὶ μὲν οὖν φαντασίας, τί ἐστι καὶ διὰ τί ἐστιν, εἰρήσθω ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον.

And speaking generally, as objects are separable from their matter, so also are the corresponding faculties of the mind.

<@347.24@ {QUESTION} {PROBLEM} 
if mind is a simple thing, and not liable to be acted upon, and has nothing in common with anything else, as Anaxagoras says, how till it think, if thinking is a form of being acted upon? 
{Anaxagoras} 
For it is when two things have something in common that we regard one as acting and the other as acted upon.


(2) Whether the mind itself can be an object of thought. For either mind will be present in all other objects (if, that is, mind is an object of thought in itself and not in virtue of something else, anbd what is thought is always identical in form), or else it will contain some common element, which makes it an object of thought like other things. 
Or there is the explanation which we have given before of the phrase "being acted upon in virtue of some common element" that mind is potentially identical with the obejcts of thought but is actually nothing, until it thinks.

What the mind thinks must be in it in the same sense as letters are on a tablet which bears no actual writing {analogy} {writing tablet} 
It is also itself thinkable, just like other objects of thought. For in the case of things without matter that which thinks and that which is thought are the same; for speculative knowledge is the same as its object .

We must consider why the mind does not always think.

In things which have matter, each of the objects of thought is only potentially present. 
Hence while material objects will not have mind in them (for it is apart from their matter that mind is potentially identical with them) mind will still have the capacity of being thought.

_τὸ δὲ τί ἦν εἶναι, εἰ ἔστιν ἕτερον τὸ εὐθεῖ εἶναι καὶ τὸ εὐθύ, ἄλλο· ἔστω γὰρ δυάς. ἑτέρῳ (20) ἄρα ἢ ἑτέρως ἔχοντι κρίνει. ὅλως ἄρα ὡς χωριστὰ τὰ πράγματα τῆς ὕλης, οὕτω καὶ τὰ περὶ τὸν νοῦν.



ἢ γὰρ τοῖς ἄλλοις νοῦς ὑπάρξει, εἰ μὴ κατ’ ἄλλο αὐτὸς νοητός, ἓν δέ τι τὸ νοητὸν εἴδει, ἢ μεμιγμένον τι ἕξει, ὃ ποιεῖ νοητὸν αὐτὸν ὥσπερ τἆλλα. ἢ τὸ μὲν πάσχειν κατὰ κοινόν τι διῄρηται πρότερον, ὅτι δυνάμει πώς ἐστι τὰ νοητὰ (30) ὁ νοῦς, ἀλλ’ ἐντελεχείᾳ οὐδέν, πρὶν ἂν νοῇ· δυνάμει δ’ οὕτως (430a) ὥσπερ ἐν γραμματείῳ ᾧ μηθὲν ἐνυπάρχει ἐντελεχείᾳ γεγραμ- μένον· ὅπερ συμβαίνει ἐπὶ τοῦ νοῦ. καὶ αὐτὸς δὲ νοητός ἐστιν ὥσπερ τὰ νοητά. ἐπὶ μὲν γὰρ τῶν ἄνευ ὕλης τὸ αὐτό ἐστι τὸ νοοῦν καὶ τὸ νοούμενον· ἡ γὰρ ἐπιστήμη ἡ θεωρητικὴ καὶ τὸ νοοῦν καὶ τὸ νοούμενον· ἡ γὰρ ἐπιστήμη ἡ θεωρητικὴ καὶ τὸ οὕτως ἐπιστητὸν τὸ αὐτό ἐστιν (τοῦ δὲ μὴ ἀεὶ νοεῖν τὸ (5) αἴτιον ἐπισκεπτέον)· ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἔχουσιν ὕλην δυνάμει ἕκαστον ἔστι τῶν νοητῶν. ὥστ’ ἐκείνοις μὲν οὐχ ὑπάρξει νοῦς (ἄνευ γὰρ ὕλης δύναμις ὁ νοῦς τῶν τοιούτων), ἐκείνῳ δὲ τὸ νοη- τὸν ὑπάρξει.

<@347.25@ {book@3} {chapter@5} 
The soul, like every other kind of object, has both matter, what is potentially all the individuals, and something else which is their cause or agent in that it makes them all.

Hence both a "passive mind" and an "active mind" 
"this is a kind of positive state like light; for in a sense light makes potential into actual colours" 

Mind in this sense is separable, impassive {apathēs} and unmixed, since it is essentially an activity {energeia} 
the {archē} = originating cause, vs. matter 
actual knowledge is identical with its object.

But it does not sometimes think {noein} and sometimes not think...

When isolated, it is is even which thing it is and this alone immortal {athanaton} and eternal {aidion} ...(we do not remember because, whil mind in this sense cannot be acted upon, mind in the passive sense is perishable), and without this nothing thinks.

<@347.26@ {book@3} {chapter@6} 
The thinking of indivisible objects of thought occurs among things concerning which there can be no falsegood; where {truth} and {falsehood} are possible there is implied a compounding of thoughts into a fresh unity, as Empedocles said, "where without necks the hears of many grew," and then were joined together by Love, so also these separate entities are combined as for instance {incommensurable} and {diagonal} {love} {philia/gr} 
Ἡ μὲν οὖν τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νόησις ἐν τούτοις περὶ ἃ οὐκ ἔστι τὸ ψεῦδος, ἐν οἷς δὲ καὶ τὸ ψεῦδος καὶ τὸ ἀληθές σύν- θεσίς τις ἤδη νοημάτων ὥσπερ ἓν ὄντων-καθάπερ Ἐμπεδο- κλῆς ἔφη "ᾗ πολλῶν μὲν κόρσαι ἀναύχενες ἐβλάστησαν", ἔπειτα συντίθεσθαι τῇ φιλίᾳ, οὕτω καὶ ταῦτα κεχωρισμένα (30) συντίθεται, οἷον τὸ ἀσύμμετρον καὶ ἡ διάμετρος- 
But if the thinking is concerned with things past or future, then we take into account and include the notion of time. For falsehood always lies in the process of combination, for if a man calls white non-white has cambined the notion not-white 
ἂν δὲ γενο- (430b) μένων ἢ ἐσομένων, τὸν χρόνον προσεννοῶν [καὶ] συντίθησι. τὸ γὰρ ψεῦδος ἐν συνθέσει ἀεί· καὶ γὰρ ἂν τὸ λευκὸν μὴ λευκὸν [φῇ, τὸ λευκὸν καὶ] τὸ μὴ λευκὸν συνέθηκεν· ἐνδέχεται δὲ καὶ διαίρεσιν φάναι πάντα. ἀλλ’ οὖν ἔστι γε οὐ μόνον τὸ ψεῦδος ἢ ἀλη- θὲς ὅτι λευκὸς Κλέων ἐστίν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅτι ἦν ἢ ἔσται. τὸ δὲ ἓν (5) ποιοῦν ἕκαστον, τοῦτο ὁ νοῦς.

to de en poioun hekaston, touto ho nous 
"but if the line is thought of as the sum of two halves, it is also thought of in a time which covers both half periods" {compare@Kant} {temporality} {synthesis} 

_εἰ δ’ ὡς ἐξ ἀμφοῖν, καὶ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τῷ ἐπ’ ἀμφοῖν 
But when the object of thought is not quantitatively but qualitatively indivisible, the mind thinks of it in indivisible time, and by an indivisible activity of the soul.

τὸ δὲ μὴ κατὰ τὸ ποσὸν ἀδιαίρετον ἀλλὰ τῷ εἴ- δει νοεῖ ἐν ἀδιαιρέτῳ χρόνῳ καὶ ἀδιαιρέτῳ τῆς ψυχῆς.] 
all divisions then are apprehended as privations 
This applies to everything else too: all cognizing {gnōrizein} is by opposites 

_καὶ ὅμοιος ὁ λόγος ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων, οἷον πῶς τὸ κακὸν γνωρίζει ἢ τὸ μέλαν· τῷ ἐναντίῳ γάρ πως γνωρίζει.

The cognizing agent must be potentially one contrary, and contain the other.

But if there is anything which has no contrary, it is self-cognizant, actual and separately existent.

δεῖ δὲ δυνάμει εἶναι τὸ γνωρίζον καὶ †ἐνεῖναι ἐν αὐτῷ†. εἰ δέ τινι μηδὲν ἔστιν ἐναντίον [τῶν αἰτίων], αὐτὸ ἑαυτὸ γινώσκει καὶ ἐνέργειά ἐστι (25) καὶ χωριστόν 
Assertion, like affirmation, states an attribute of a subject and is always either true or false; but this is not always so with the mind: the thinking of the definition in the sense of the essence is always true and is not an instance of predication : but just as while the seeing of the proper object is always true, the judgment whether the white object is a man or not is not always true, so it is with every object abstracted from its matter.

ἔστι δ’ ἡ μὲν φάσις τι κατά τινος, ὥσπερ καὶ ἡ ἀπόφασις, καὶ ἀληθὴς ἢ ψευδὴς πᾶσα· ὁ δὲ νοῦς οὐ πᾶς, ἀλλ’ ὁ τοῦ τί ἐστι κατὰ τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι ἀληθής, καὶ οὐ τὶ κατά @1 τινος· ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ τὸ ὁρᾶν †τοῦ ἰδίου ἀληθές, εἰ δ’ ἄνθρωπος

Knowledge {epistēmē} when actively operative is identified with its object. In the individual potential knowledge has priority in time, but generally it is not prior even in time, for everything comes out of that which actually is.

<@347.28@ And clearly the sensible object makes the sense-faculty actually operative from being only potential; it is not acted upon, nor does it undergo a change of state; and so, if it is motion, it is motion of a distinct kind; for {motion} as we say is an activity of the imperfect, but activity in the absolute sense, that is activity of the perfected, is different. Sensation then is like mere assertion and thinking; when an object is pleasant or unpleasant, the soul pursues or avoids or it, thereby making a sort of assertion or negation.

_ἡ γὰρ κίνησις τοῦ ἀτελοῦς ἐνέργεια, ἡ δ’ ἁπλῶς ἐνέργεια ἑτέρα, ἡ τοῦ τετελεσμένου. - τὸ μὲν οὖν αἰσθάνεσθαι ὅμοιον τῷ φάναι μόνον καὶ νοεῖν· ὅταν δὲ ἡδὺ ἢ λυπηρόν, οἷον καταφᾶσα ἢ ἀποφᾶσα διώκει ἢ φεύγει· καὶ ἔστι τὸ ἥδεσθαι καὶ λυπεῖσθαι τὸ ἐνεργεῖν (10) τῇ αἰσθητικῇ μεσότητι πρὸς τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἢ κακόν, ᾗ τοιαῦτα.

To feel pleasure or pain is to adopt an attitude with the sensitive mean towards the good or bad as such.

καὶ ἔστι τὸ ἥδεσθαι καὶ λυπεῖσθαι τὸ ἐνεργεῖν (10) τῇ αἰσθητικῇ μεσότητι πρὸς τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἢ κακόν, ᾗ τοιαῦτα.

This is what avoidance or appetite, when actual, really means, and the faculties of appetite or avoidance are not really different from each other, or from the sensitive faculty, though their actual essence is different 
καὶ ἡ φυγὴ δὲ καὶ ἡ ὄρεξις ταὐτό, ἡ κατ’ ἐνέργειαν, καὶ οὐχ ἕτερον τὸ ὀρεκτικὸν καὶ τὸ φευκτικόν, οὔτ’ ἀλλήλων οὔτε τοῦ αἰσθητικοῦ· ἀλλὰ τὸ εἶναι ἄλλο.

Now for the thinking soul images take the place of direct perceptions; and when it asserts or denies that they are good or bad, it avoids or pursues them. Hence the soul never things wihtout a mental image. 
τῇ δὲ διανοητικῇ ψυχῇ τὰ φαντάσματα οἷον αἰσθήματα ὑπάρχει, ὅταν δὲ ἀγαθὸν (15) ἢ κακὸν φήσῃ ἢ ἀποφήσῃ, φεύγει ἢ διώκει· διὸ οὐδέποτε νοεῖ ἄνευ φαντάσματος ἡ ψυχή. 
The process is just like that in which air affects the eye in a particular way, and the eye again affects something else; and similarly with hearing. The last thing to be affects is a single entity and a single mean, although it has more than one aspect.

ὥσπερ δὲ ὁ ἀὴρ τὴν κό- ρην τοιανδὶ ἐποίησεν, αὕτη δ’ ἕτερον, καὶ ἡ ἀκοὴ ὡσ- αύτως, τὸ δὲ ἔσχατον ἕν, καὶ μία [ἡ] μεσότης, τὸ δ’ εἶναι αὐτῇ

SO when the mind thinks the objects of mathematics, it thinks them as separable though actually they are not. In general, the mind when actively thinking is identical with its objects. Whether it is possible for the mind to think of unextended objects when it is not itself unextended, must be considered later.

summing up...let us assert once more: the soul is all existing things.

Νῦν δέ, περὶ ψυχῆς τὰ λεχθέντα συγκεφαλαιώσαντες, (20) εἴπωμεν πάλιν ὅτι ἡ ψυχὴ τὰ ὄντα πώς ἐστι πάντα· 
What exists is either sensible or intelligible; and in a sense knowledge is the knowable and sensation the sensible.

We consider in what sense this is so.

ἢ εἴπωμεν πάλιν ὅτι ἡ ψυχὴ τὰ ὄντα πώς ἐστι πάντα· ἢ γὰρ αἰσθητὰ τὰ ὄντα ἢ νοητά, ἔστι δ’ ἡ ἐπιστήμη μὲν τὰ ἐπιστητά πως, ἡ δ’ αἴσθησις τὰ αἰσθητά· πῶς δὲ τοῦτο, δεῖ ζητεῖν 
Both knowledge and sensation are divided to correspond to their objects, the potential to the potential, and the actual to the actual.

τέμνεται οὖν ἡ ἐπιστήμη καὶ ἡ αἴσθησις εἰς τὰ πράγματα, ἡ μὲν δυνάμει εἰς τὰ δυνάμει, ἡ δ’ ἐντελε- (25) χείᾳ εἰς τὰ ἐντελεχείᾳ· {epistēmē} {aisthēsis} 
[corresponds = eis ta pragmata!] {dunamis} {entelecheia} 
The sensitive and congitive faculties of the soul are potentially these objects, vis. the sensible and the knowable.

τῆς δὲ ψυχῆς τὸ αἰσθητικὸν καὶ τὸ ἐπιστημονικὸν δυνάμει ταὐτά ἐστι, τὸ μὲν [τὸ] ἐπιστητὸν τὸ δὲ [τὸ] αἰσθητόν.

These faculties must thus be identical either with the objects themselves or with their forms. 
ἀνάγκη δ’ ἢ αὐτὰ ἢ τὰ εἴδη εἶναι.

They are not identical with the objects; for the stone does not exist in the soul, but only the form of the stone.

αὐτὰ μὲν δὴ οὔ· οὐ γὰρ ὁ λίθος ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ, ἀλλὰ τὸ εἶ- (432a) δος· 
The soul, then, acts like a hand; for the hand is an instrument which employs instruments, and in the same way, the mind is a form which employs forms, and sense is a form which employs the forms of sensible objects.

ὥστε ἡ ψυχὴ ὥσπερ ἡ χείρ ἐστιν· καὶ γὰρ ἡ χεὶρ ὄργανόν ἐστιν ὀργάνων, καὶ ὁ νοῦς εἶδος εἰδῶν καὶ ἡ αἴ- @1 σθησις εἶδος αἰσθητῶν. 
But since apparently nothing has a separate existence, except sensible magnitudes, then object of thought ---both the so-called abstractins of mathematics and all states and affections of sensible things-- reside in the sensible forms. 
. ἐπεὶ δὲ οὐδὲ πρᾶγμα οὐθὲν ἔστι παρὰ τὰ μεγέθη, ὡς δοκεῖ, τὰ αἰσθητὰ κεχωρισμένον, ἐν τοῖς εἴδεσι τοῖς αἰσθητοῖς τὰ νοητά ἐστι, τά τε ἐν ἀφ- (5) αιρέσει λεγόμενα καὶ ὅσα τῶν αἰσθητῶν ἕξεις καὶ πάθη.

And for this reason as no one could ever learn or understand anything wihtout the exercise of perception, so even when we think speculatively, we must have some mental picture of which to think; for mental images are similar top objects perceived except that they are without matter. 
καὶ διὰ τοῦτο οὔτε μὴ αἰσθανόμενος μηθὲν οὐθὲν ἂν μάθοι οὐδὲ ξυνείη, ὅταν τε θεωρῇ, ἀνάγκη ἅμα φάντασμά τι θεωρεῖν· τὰ γὰρ φαντάσματα ὥσπερ αἰσθήματά ἐστι, πλὴν ἄνευ ὕλης.

But imagination is not the same thing as assertion and denial; for truth and falsehood involve a combination of notions. How then will the simplest notions differ from mental pictures] Surely neither these simple notions nor any others are mental pictures, but they cannot occur without mental pictures.

ἔστι δ’ ἡ φαντασία ἕτερον φάσεως καὶ (10) ἀποφάσεως· συμπλοκὴ γὰρ νοημάτων ἐστὶ τὸ ἀληθὲς ἢ ψεῦδος. τὰ δὲ πρῶτα νοήματα τί διοίσει τοῦ μὴ φαν-

These two then, appetite and mind, are clearly capable of causing movement if, that is, one regards imagination as some kind of thinking process. 
for men often follow their imagination contrary to knowledge, and in living creatures other than man there is neither thinking nor calculation, but only imagination 
BUt...mind and appetite.. are productive of movement in space...

the practical mind ...makes its calculations with an end in view.

so there two, appetite and practical thought, seem reasonably considered as the producers of movement; for the obejct of appetite produces movement, and therefore thought produced movement, because the object of appetite is its beginning...

That which moves, then, is the single faculty, the appetite.

mind...mever seems to produce movement without appetite (for {will} {boulēsis/gr} is a form of appetite, and when movement accord with calculation {logismos} it also accords with choice) 
but appetite produces movement contrary to calculation; for desire {spithumia} is a form of appetite {orexis} 
Now mind is always right {orthos}, but appetite and imagination may be right {othos} or not right.

THus the object of appetite always produces movement, but this may be either the real or the apparent good; and not every good can excite movement, but only practical good. 
PRactical good is that which is capable of being otherwise {practical good}

(for the mind advises us to resist with a view to the future, while desire only looks to the present; for what is momentarily pleasant seems to be absolutely pleasant and absolutely good, because desire cannot look to the future)

THe source of movement in imperfect animals, only possessing the sense of touch.

Do they have {imagination} {phantasia} and {desire} {epithumia} 
Since they are liable to {pain} and {pleasure}, they must have {desire}...

Perhaps, just as their movements are indeterminate, so they also have imagination and desire, but only indeterminately 
Imagination in the form of sense is found, as we have said, in all animals, but deliberative imaginaton only in the calculative.

Σκεπτέον δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν ἀτελῶν τί τὸ κινοῦν ἐστιν, 
_(434a) οἷς ἁφῇ μόνον ὑπάρχει αἴσθησις, πότερον ἐνδέχεται φαν- τασίαν ὑπάρχειν τούτοις, ἢ οὔ, καὶ ἐπιθυμίαν. φαίνεται γὰρ λύπη καὶ ἡδονὴ ἐνοῦσα, εἰ δὲ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπιθυμίαν ἀνάγκη.
φαντασία δὲ πῶς ἂν ἐνείη; ἢ ὥσπερ καὶ κινεῖται ἀορίστως, καὶ ταῦτ’ ἔνεστι μέν, ἀορίστως δ’ ἔνεστιν. ἡ μὲν οὖν αἰσθητικὴ (5) φαντασία, ὥσπερ εἴρηται, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις ζῴοις ὑπάρ- @1 χει, ἡ δὲ βουλευτικὴ ἐν τοῖς λογιστικοῖς (πότερον γὰρ πρά- ξει τόδε ἢ τόδε, λογισμοῦ ἤδη ἐστὶν ἔργον 

for to decide whether one shall do this or that calls at once for calculation, and one must measure by a single standard; for one pursues the greater good.

. ἡ μὲν οὖν αἰσθητικὴ (5) φαντασία, ὥσπερ εἴρηται, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις ζῴοις ὑπάρ- @1 χει, ἡ δὲ βουλευτικὴ ἐν τοῖς λογιστικοῖς (πότερον γὰρ πρά- ξει τόδε ἢ τόδε, λογισμοῦ ἤδη ἐστὶν ἔργον· καὶ ἀνάγκη ἑνὶ μετρεῖν· τὸ μεῖζον γὰρ διώκει· ὥστε δύναται ἓν ἐκ πλειόνων φαντασμάτων ποιεῖν).

This implies the ability to combine several images into one. This is why imagination is thought not to involve opinion {doxa}, bcause it does not involve opinion which is based on inference, whereas opinion involves imagination. Hence appetite does not imply capacity for deliberation.

ὥστε δύναται ἓν ἐκ πλειόνων φαντασμάτων ποιεῖν). καὶ αἴτιον τοῦτο τοῦ δόξαν μὴ δοκεῖν (10) ἔχειν, ὅτι τὴν ἐκ συλλογισμοῦ οὐκ ἔχει, αὕτη δὲ κινεῖ· διὸ τὸ βουλευτικὸν οὐκ ἔχει ἡ ὄρεξις 
{akrasia} {lack of self-control} 
The cognitive faculty is not moved but remains still. Since one premise or statement is universal and the other particular (for the one asserts that a man in such a position should do such a thing, but the other asserts that this present act is such a thing and that I am a man in such a position), it is surely this latter opinion whcih causes movement, not the universal. Or perhaps it is both, but the univeral tends to remain at rest, and the other does not.

νικᾷ δ’ ἐνίοτε καὶ κινεῖ ὁτὲ μὲν αὕτη ἐκείνην, ὁτὲ δ’ ἐκείνη ταύτην, ὥσπερ σφαῖρα [σφαῖραν], ἡ ὄρεξις τὴν ὄρεξιν, ὅταν ἀκρασία γένηται· φύσει δὲ ἀεὶ ἡ ἄνω ἀρχικωτέρα καὶ κινεῖ· ὥστε τρεῖς φορὰς ἤδη κινεῖσθαι. (15) τὸ δ’ ἐπιστημονικὸν οὐ κινεῖται, ἀλλὰ μένει. ἐπεὶ δ’ ἡ μὲν καθόλου ὑπόληψις καὶ λόγος, ἡ δὲ τοῦ καθ’ ἕκαστον (ἡ μὲν γὰρ λέγει ὅτι δεῖ τὸν τοιοῦτον τὸ τοιόνδε πράττειν, ἡ δὲ ὅτι τόδε τοιόνδε, κἀγὼ δὲ τοιόσδε), ἢ δὴ αὕτη κινεῖ ἡ δόξα, οὐχ ἡ καθόλου, ἢ ἄμφω, ἀλλ’ ἡ μὲν ἠρεμοῦσα μᾶλλον, ἡ δ’ οὔ.
